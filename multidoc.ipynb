       "[Document(id='2023 Outlook', metadata={}, page_content='Commodities were a bright spot for markets last \\nyear (see Exhibit 180). The S&P GSCI returned \\n23%, topping all other major asset classes for a \\nsecond consecutive year. But this impressive gain \\nbelied a more nuanced reality, as returns reached \\n54% by early June, only to be halved in the \\nsecond half of the year. Investors also faced a wide \\ndispersion among individual commodities and their \\nsource of returns. In contrast to the index’s overall \\nstrength, both industrial metals and precious \\nmetals suffered losses last year. And while the \\nenergy subindex outperformed with a 39% gain, \\nthe bulk of this came from positive carry, or the \\nadditional return holders of a commodity get when \\nthe futures curve is strongly downward sloping, \\ncalled “backwardation.” The appreciation in spot \\nenergy prices was a much smaller 14%.  \\n\\n\\nThe disjointed nature of these returns reflects \\nthe tug-of-war between bullish supply-side \\npressures and bearish demand-side concerns that is \\nlikely to continue in the year ahead. Although years \\nof underinvestment are an underlying support for \\nmany commodity prices, a deeper global economic \\nslowdown could quickly undermine demand, \\nespecially given the still-uncertain trajectory of \\nChina’s economy amid its shifting COVID policies. \\n\\n\\nAgainst these risks, we note that global \\ninventories have remained low across most \\ncommodities despite months of weak Chinese \\ndemand—a sign of equally weak supply trends. A \\nthinner inventory buffer also leaves prices sensitive \\nto potential supply disruptions in politically \\nunstable areas, such as South America for base \\nmetals, or—discussed further below—Russia and \\nthe Middle East for oil. Given these crosscurrents, \\nwe believe that risks around our base case are \\nroughly balanced for industrial metals and oil \\nprices this year. As for gold, we remain doubtful \\nabout its ability to provide investors with a reliable \\nhedge against inflation or political risk given its \\nnotable failure to do so in the past year.  \\n\\n\\nOil: High Risks, Low Inventories\\nOil prices last year were driven by geopolitical \\ndevelopments to a degree not seen since the \\nturbulent 1970s. As seen in Exhibit 181, close \\nto 10% of global oil production found itself at \\nrisk of disruption virtually overnight in the wake \\nof Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing \\nrollout of Western sanctions. Given already low \\nglobal oil inventories and thin spare capacity, oil \\nprices understandably spiked higher, reaching $124 \\nat their peak closing level last March. \\n\\n\\nPrices have since fallen back below pre-war \\nlevels. This surprising retracement reflects not only \\nthe failure of supply risks to materialize, but also \\na combination of bearish developments, including \\nan unprecedented 200-million-barrel release from \\nthe US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a COVID-\\ndriven slump in Chinese oil demand and fears of \\nan impending recession. \\n\\n\\nAlthough oil prices have receded, the bullish \\nrisks that underpinned their initial spike higher \\nhave not disappeared. The full effect of European \\nsanctions on Russia will not be visible in energy \\nmarkets until the first quarter of this year. These \\ncurbs directly impact 0.5 million b/d of seaborne \\ncrude oil and 1.1 million b/d of refined products. \\nWhile Russia has so far been successful at \\nredirecting crude exports to India and China, this \\nstrategy is starting to show some limits (see Exhibit \\n182). Moreover, it will be difficult for Russia to \\nreplicate this strategy in refined products, as both \\nChina and India were net exporters in this category \\nlast year.\\n\\n\\nAs a result, close to 2 million b/d of Russian \\nsupplies to Europe remain at risk. Consensus \\ncurrently expects a net loss of less than half that \\namount, increasing the risk of an upside surprise. \\nUpward pressure on energy prices could also \\narise from supply disruptions in other countries, \\ngiven geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and \\ndomestic instability in Libya and other exporting \\ncountries.  \\n\\n\\nTo be sure, the demand for oil faces an equally \\nhigh degree of risk amid a potential US recession and \\nthe still-uncertain trajectory of China’s economy. We \\nestimate that Chinese demand fell by 0.5 million b/d \\non average last year, marking the first annual decline \\nsince 1990 (see Exhibit 183). While a successful \\nreopening of China’s economy could help offset \\nweaker oil demand elsewhere, a more protracted \\nCOVID wave could exacerbate demand concerns. \\nFor now, we expect global demand to remain on an \\nupward trajectory in our base case, exceeding pre-\\nCOVID levels by year-end.  \\n\\n\\nMeeting this demand will require continuing \\ngrowth from US producers, as OPEC has already \\nramped its output back to pre-COVID levels \\nand has limited spare capacity. But to incentivize \\nadditional drilling, oil prices must remain high \\nenough to overcome the cost inflation and self-\\nimposed capital discipline now holding back \\nUS production. In contrast, lower prices and \\ndisappointing demand would likely restrain \\nproduction growth. Tellingly, the November and \\nDecember oil price slump was rapidly followed by \\na decline in US drilling and completion activity, \\nwhile OPEC immediately announced a production \\ncut to rescue prices. \\n\\n\\nGiven these moving pieces, we expect WTI \\nprices to trade in a $70–100 range by year-end, \\nwhich would imply upside from current levels. \\nBut we are mindful of the many risks that could \\nundermine this forecast—including a US recession, \\nanother wave of global COVID infections or a \\nquick resolution to the conflict in Ukraine—any \\none of which could push prices down to cost \\nsupport near $60. That said, we would not expect \\nthese lower prices to be sustained for an extended \\nperiod, given producers’ likely reaction. There are \\nalso upside risks. Any additional supply disruptions \\nwould be magnified by still-low inventories, which could push prices above our \\nforecast range, as happened last year. \\n\\n\\nAlthough we do not have an active tactical \\nallocation to oil, we do continue to recommend \\na small overweight to the US midstream sector, \\nwhich benefits from strong cash flows and less \\ndirect exposure to oil price volatility.\\n\\n\\nGold: Not as Advertised\\nSince its meteoric rise in the 1970s, gold has been \\nhailed as an effective hedge against inflation. But \\nthat reputation was tarnished in 2022, as gold \\nprices spent most of the year trading in negative \\nterritory despite the highest inflation in four \\ndecades. This disappointing performance was \\nyet another reminder that gold is subject to a \\nmultitude of often opposing factors. Case in point: \\nthe impact of last year’s inflation surprise was \\nlargely offset by the combination of higher interest \\nrates and the surge in the US dollar, with which \\ngold tends to be negatively correlated.\\n\\n\\nThese types of crosscurrents leave us tactically \\nneutral on gold again this year. As seen in Exhibit \\n185, our expectation for softer nominal and \\nreal interest rates removes one of last year’s key \\nheadwinds to gold. Yet real rates are still likely \\nto remain in positive territory, which historically \\nhas resulted in lower-than-average gold returns \\n(see Exhibit 186). After all, positive interest rates \\ncreate an opportunity cost of holding gold, which \\ngenerates no cash flow or yield income and must \\nbe physically stored, often at a cost. \\n\\n\\nWe also do not see a compelling argument for \\ninvestors to replace their US dollar holdings with \\ngold this year, given our still constructive view on \\nthe currency. Consider that since 1971, there has \\nbeen only a 24% chance of a meaningful gold \\nrally of more than 10% in periods when the dollar \\nwas stable or rising. In fact, most meaningful \\ngold rallies have happened when the US dollar \\nwas depreciating. Put simply, when the dollar is \\nappreciating—a situation we expect this year—\\nthe low probability of strong gold returns has \\nnot historically justified the risk and volatility of \\nholding the yellow metal.   \\n\\n\\nStill, there are a few factors that could buoy \\ngold, not the least of which is a US recession that \\nmight rekindle demand for gold as a safe-haven \\nasset. Gold also stands to benefit if currently \\nunderweight investors increase their positions \\n(see Exhibit 187), which now stand 28% below \\ntheir recent peak in early 2022 and back at levels \\nlast seen in early 2020. Demand from EM central \\nbanks looking to diversify their FX reserves into \\ngold is another source of upside risk. The latest \\ndata from the World Gold Council already points \\nto record-high purchases in the most recent \\nquarter, with countries such as Turkey, China and \\nIndia leading the pack. Further geopolitical strife \\ncould even accelerate this trend.  \\n\\n\\nGiven these contradictory factors, we remain \\nneutral on gold until a clearer opportunity \\npresents itself. '),\n",
       " Document(id='2024 Outlook', metadata={}, page_content='Last year reminded commodity investors that it’s \\nnever wise to count chickens before they hatch. \\nFollowing two years of strong performance that \\nhad reinforced investors’ belief in a new supercycle, \\nthe GSCI instead fell 9% in 2023 (see Exhibit \\n172). The losses were broad-based, with negative \\nprice performance across energy, agriculture and \\nindustrial metals.  \\n\\n\\nThe high prices of commodities coming into \\nlast year proved to be the antidote for even higher \\nprices, as they incentivized a mix of demand \\nconservation, investment in supply capacity and \\nproductivity improvements. This dynamic was \\nparticularly visible in the oil patch last year, where \\nproduction exceeded expectations in several \\ncountries despite producers’ capital discipline. The \\nresulting spare capacity is likely to limit upside \\nagain this year, barring major supply disruptions.   \\n\\n\\nOutside of commonly traded commodity \\nindices, there were a couple bright spots. Uranium \\nsaw a strong rally, gaining 90% last year. We \\ncontinue to recommend a small overweight to \\nuranium, a position we initiated in March 2022 \\nbased on our view that the widening gap between \\nsupply and demand would push prices higher. With \\nsupply being slow to respond despite last year’s \\nrally, we expect uranium prices to rise further \\nthis year. \\n\\n\\nGold also stood out last year, posting a 13% \\nreturn. However, we think the backdrop for gold is \\nmore challenging in 2024, given near-record prices \\nand a more mixed fundamental outlook. \\n\\n\\nOil: Threading the Needle\\n“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into \\ntrouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t \\nso.” That quote, often attributed to Mark Twain, \\nproved apt for oil investors last year, as some \\nwidely expected developments failed to materialize. \\nThe almost universal expectation that oil prices \\nwould surge due to Russian sanctions limiting \\nsupply did not occur. Instead, Russia successfully \\nredirected most of these sanctioned exports to \\nChina and India. Predictions of a slowdown in US \\nproduction growth also missed the mark, as US \\nproducers recorded their fastest growth rate since \\n2019. With these bullish catalysts not happening \\nthe way people thought they would, oil prices \\nended the year with a modest 11% loss.\\n\\n\\nOil begins the year trading at the lower end of \\nits annual range. However, this does not negate the \\npotential downside risks for 2024, as we anticipate \\nchallenges stemming from both demand and \\nsupply dynamics. Sustaining the recent demand \\ngrowth rate will be challenging now that the post-\\npandemic recovery has largely run its course. We \\npredict that demand growth will return to a trend-\\nlike pace of 1.0–1.5 million b/d this year in the \\nabsence of a recession, a significant deceleration \\nfrom last year’s 2.3 million b/d increase (see \\nExhibit 173).\\n\\n\\nThis slower demand growth will likely require \\nrestraint on the part of producers to keep the \\nmarket in balance. For their part, US producers \\nhave consistently demonstrated discipline in their \\nallocation of capital. Over the last 12 months, these \\nproducers have returned 49% of their cash flows \\nto investors compared to 37% per year between \\n2014 and 2019. However, productivity has also \\nimproved in recent years, such that the same dollar \\nof capital spending now generates more oil. As a \\nresult, US production is likely to continue growing \\ndespite ongoing capital discipline. \\n\\n\\nThe potential for output restraint among other \\nnon-OPEC producers is just as dubious. Brazil, \\nGuyana and Canada have all experienced a notable \\nuptick in their oil output recently. What’s \\nmore, their production is unlikely to be \\naffected by oil prices, as it stems from \\nyears of investment in offshore and oil \\nsands projects that are just now coming \\nonline. Ultimately, oil production from \\nthese projects could crowd out further \\nexpansion from US shale. \\nThe high prices of commodities \\ncoming into last year proved to be the \\nantidote for even higher prices.\\n\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, the burden of managing \\nsupply relative to demand rests with OPEC, where \\nthere is arguably little room for further reductions. \\nOPEC production already stands at 10-year lows \\nand has been higher than current levels 88% of \\nthe time in the past 20 years73 (see Exhibit 174). \\nSimilarly, the production of Saudi Arabia—often \\nconsidered the ultimate swing producer—has \\nseldom fallen below its current level. Going \\nforward, OPEC’s determination to support prices \\ncould be tested if further production cuts become \\nnecessary. Indeed, at OPEC’s November 2023 \\nmeeting, the decision to further reduce production \\nsparked internal disagreements, leading to Angola’s \\nexit from the organization in protest.\\n\\n\\nConsidering these challenges, we expect WTI \\nprices to trade in a $60–80 range by year-end, \\nimplying minimal upside from current levels. That \\nsaid, we are mindful of several risks that could \\npotentially undermine our forecast. The likelihood \\nof supply disruptions is growing given prevalent \\ngeopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East, as well \\nas instability in countries like Libya and Nigeria. \\nAt the same time, global oil production outages \\nexcluding Russia currently stand near their lowest \\nlevel in 10 years (see Exhibit 175).  While any price \\nspike would likely be temporary given OPEC’s \\nhistorically high spare capacity (see Exhibit 176), \\na spike could still cause significant disruptions in \\nthe short term. There are also legitimate downside \\nrisks to oil prices, including a US recession, an \\nabrupt reversal of OPEC cuts or even a lack of \\nproduction discipline among OPEC members. \\n\\n\\nIn light of these various crosscurrents, we \\ndo not have an active tactical allocation to oil. \\nHowever, we continue to recommend a small \\noverweight position to the US midstream sector, \\nwhich benefits from strong cash flows, growing \\nvolumes and less direct exposure to oil price \\nvolatility.   \\n\\n\\nGold: Breakout Mania\\nThere is nothing quite as captivating to investors as \\na new all-time high—like that reached by gold in \\nlate December last year, when its price hit $2,077. \\nThis milestone not only fueled expectations for \\nfurther gains, but also reinforced investors’ faith \\nin several bullish catalysts for gold. These included \\nso-called de-dollarization of central banks’ \\nreserves, falling interest rates and investors’ search \\nfor safe-haven assets in times of global uncertainty. \\n\\n\\nBut as investors, we must avoid fitting a \\nnarrative to an asset’s price movements. Gold \\ndid indeed rally alongside bonds late last year, \\nbut the catalyst for the bond move was signs \\nof moderating inflation—whereas gold has the \\nreputation of being an inflation hedge. Moreover, \\nmost assets rallied during last year’s fourth quarter: \\ngold’s 11.6% return was similar to the 11.7% \\ngain of US equities but higher than the 6.8% \\nadvance of the US aggregate bond index. It is also \\nworth highlighting that this isn’t gold’s first time \\nsurpassing $2,000. In fact, it also exceeded this \\nlevel in August 2020 and March 2022, but reversed \\ncourse shortly after on both occasions. \\n\\n\\nFor the year ahead, we see several crosscurrents \\nimpacting the outlook for gold. To be sure, gold \\nhas a few supportive factors. There is scope for \\ninvestors to increase their ETF exposure to gold, \\nas current positions are more than 25 million \\nounces below their 2020 peak (see Exhibit 177). \\nEmerging market central banks are also increasing \\ntheir exposure, as they continue to diversify some \\nof their reserves into gold. Based on data up to the \\nthird quarter of last year, these central banks added \\naround 1,000 tonnes of gold to their balance sheets \\nlast year, accounting for nearly 30% of global gold \\nproduction. However, this is not an incremental \\nsource of demand, as they purchased about the \\nsame amount the previous year (see Exhibit 178). \\n\\n\\nAs was the case last year, our expectation \\nfor lower nominal interest rates could also \\nbenefit gold. Recall that lower rates reduce the \\nopportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t \\nyield any income and needs to be stored, often \\nat a cost. This interest rate dynamic can also be \\nindirectly observed through gold’s positive reaction \\nto past Federal Reserve rate cuts. In fact, in the six \\nmonths following the first rate cut of a cycle, gold \\nprices have rallied 60% of the time, by a median of \\n6.2% (see Exhibit 179). \\n\\n\\nHowever, the fact that disinflation is pushing \\ninterest rates lower could weaken this dynamic. That \\nhas been the case historically, as real interest rates \\nhave been a more important driver of gold prices \\nthan nominal interest rates. Falling but positive real \\nrates, which we expect this year, have historically \\nbeen roughly neutral for gold prices compared to \\ntheir unconditional performance. Capitalizing on \\nthese rate movements also requires precise timing, as \\nthe median gold return in the six months before the \\nfirst Federal Reserve rate cut has been a 1.9% loss, \\nwith only a 50% chance of a gain. \\n\\n\\nWe do not expect the US dollar \\nto provide a clear catalyst to gold \\nprices either. While there is a negative \\ncorrelation between gold and the \\ndollar, it has historically taken a large \\ndollar depreciation to push gold prices \\nmeaningfully higher, which is not our \\ncentral case. In fact, we expect the dollar \\nto appreciate this year. \\nThere is nothing quite as captivating \\nto investors as a new all-time high—\\nlike that reached by gold in late \\nDecember last year.\\n\\n\\nIn short, we do not believe these conflicting \\nfactors convincingly justify today’s already high \\ngold prices, leaving us neutral until a clearer \\nopportunity presents itself.

       " Document(id='2025 Outlook', metadata={}, page_content='Commodity markets often change the locks just \\nwhen investors think they have found the keys. \\nRecent years have been no exception: investors \\ngained confidence after two consecutive years of \\nexcess returns in 2021 and 2022—fueled by supply \\nchain disruptions, rising inflation and Russia’s \\ninvasion of Ukraine—only to be caught off guard \\nby losses in 2023 and just a modest rebound last \\nyear. The GSCI’s 4% return in 2024 also masked \\nuneven performance across subsectors. Gains in \\nprecious metals and livestock weren’t enough to \\noffset losses in agriculture and industrial metals.\\n\\n\\nThe relative stability in energy prices last year \\nstood in stark contrast to pervasive geopolitical \\nrisks and moderating demand growth. This \\nresilience reflected historically high spare capacity \\nin oil markets, which helped balance declining \\ninventories and modest periodic disruptions. \\nLooking ahead, we expect steady global economic \\ngrowth to support demand, while ample spare \\ncapacity should again keep prices in check, barring \\na major supply disruption.\\n\\n\\nGold emerged as a standout performer last \\nyear, reaching a new all-time high in October and \\noutperforming the S&P 500 with a 27% spot \\nreturn. Its strength was driven by a combination of \\nfactors, including elevated central bank purchases, \\nmonetary easing, rising national debt concerns and \\ngeopolitical risks.\\n\\n\\nWhile we remain neutral on commodities \\noverall, we continue to recommend a small \\noverweight to uranium, which we believe offers \\nattractive asymmetry given an ongoing structural \\ndeficit (see Section I, Our Tactical Tilts).\\n\\n\\nOil: Uneasy Equilibrium\\nOil did not live up to its reputation for volatility \\nin 2024. Prices traded within their tightest range \\nsince 2013 in percentage terms and within their \\nnarrowest range since 1998 in real dollar terms. \\nWTI crude oil spent nearly 80% of 2024 within \\nour expected trading range of $60–80 and ended \\nthe year flat. This uncharacteristic stability reflected \\na balanced oil market, where ample spare capacity, \\ndisciplined production and moderating demand \\ngrowth combined to offset geopolitical risks.  \\n\\n\\nSupply disruptions remained modest despite \\nactive military conflicts in the Middle East \\nand Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. OPEC+ \\nmaintained remarkable discipline, extending \\nproduction cut agreements through 2026 and \\npostponing plans to unwind cuts. This resulted \\nin historically high spare capacity, providing a \\nbuffer against unexpected supply shocks (see \\nExhibit 183). Meanwhile, global oil demand \\ngrowth slowed for a third straight year, even as \\nconsumption demand recovered from pandemic \\ndistortions and reached a new all-time high.\\n\\n\\nLooking ahead to 2025, we expect trend-like \\nglobal economic activity to drive oil demand \\nhigher by around 1 million b/d, similar to last \\nyear. However, Chinese demand growth is likely to \\nremain subdued at around 0.1–0.2 million b/d due \\nto its slower economic growth (see Section II) and \\na shift away from petroleum-consuming passenger \\nand freight transportation vehicles. This would \\nleave China’s demand growth trailing India’s for a \\nsecond year (see Exhibit 184).\\n\\n\\nTo keep the market in balance, oil supply will \\nneed to increase to meet demand growth. Increased \\noil production is most likely to come from among \\nnon-OPEC+ countries, which now contribute the \\nmajority of global oil supply (see Exhibit 185). \\nIndeed, the approximately 1.2 million b/d in supply \\ngrowth we expect from countries such as the US, \\nGuyana, Brazil and Canada is sufficient to satisfy \\nglobal demand growth on its own. Moreover, much \\nof this expected growth arises from large-scale \\noffshore developments whose production is not \\nsensitive to market oil prices. \\n\\n\\nGiven this non-OPEC+ growth, the burden of \\nmanaging supply relative to demand rests with \\nOPEC+. We expect the group to maintain its recent \\nsupply discipline this year unless prices move \\nsustainably higher. This should ensure ample spare \\ncapacity to absorb unexpected disruptions. \\n\\n\\nGiven a roughly balanced oil market, we \\nexpect WTI crude oil prices to end 2025 in a range \\nof $60–80, consistent with the current forward \\ncurve and last year’s range. That said, risks to our \\noutlook remain. OPEC’s spare capacity provides a \\ntangible buffer, but the oil market’s other buffer—\\nobservable global oil inventories—is near multiyear \\nlows (see Exhibit 186). Additionally, OPEC+ could \\nchoose not to respond swiftly to a supply shock, \\nwhile weaker global demand, a lapse in OPEC+ \\nproduction discipline and larger-than-expected \\nnon-OPEC+ production growth could also test \\nmarket stability. \\n\\n\\nPolicy uncertainty also looms. The incoming \\nTrump administration may tighten sanctions on \\nIran, Russia and Venezuela, but is likely to prioritize \\nlow energy prices—balancing geopolitical objectives \\nwith domestic economic considerations. Meanwhile, \\nwhile deregulation could increase oil drilling \\npermits, logistical bottlenecks and US producers’ \\ncapital discipline make a production surge unlikely. \\n\\n\\nGiven these crosscurrents, we do not hold an \\nactive tactical position in oil currently. Instead, \\nwe continue to recommend a small overweight to \\nthe US midstream sector, which offers strong cash \\nflows, benefits from growing energy volumes and \\nhas less direct exposure to oil price volatility.\\nGold: Golden Crossroads\\nNo other commodity shined as brightly as gold \\nlast year, with its 27% surge marking the best \\nannual performance in a decade. Gold’s strength \\nwas notable for reflecting familiar drivers—\\nsizable central bank purchases, easier monetary \\npolicy, rising national debt levels and pervasive \\ngeopolitical risks—while also defying traditional \\nheadwinds, including rising real interest rates and a \\nstronger US dollar. Last year marked only the third \\ntime since 1997 in which gold rallied despite these \\nheadwinds, although its inverse correlation with \\nUS real interest rates has weakened in recent years \\n(see Exhibit 187). \\n\\n\\nThis breakdown of once-reliable relationships \\nunderscores a notable shift in the appeal of gold \\namong key buyers. Central banks—particularly in \\ncountries such as China, India and Türkiye—have \\nsharply increased gold purchases in recent years \\nas part of broader efforts to diversify foreign \\nexchange reserves and reduce reliance on the US \\ndollar. Heightened trade uncertainty, geopolitical \\ntensions, and the US dollar’s use in sanctions \\nhave further bolstered gold’s appeal in these \\nbuyers’ eyes. \\n\\n\\nGlobal central bank purchases of gold topped \\n1,000 tonnes in 2022–23 and were on track \\nto reach similar levels again late last year (see \\nExhibit 188). Consumer demand in emerging \\nmarkets has also surged, driven by gold’s enduring \\nreputation as both a store of value and a hedge \\nagainst geopolitical risk. Collectively, this \\ndemand has supported prices even amid volatile \\nmacroeconomic conditions. \\n\\n\\nThe renewed enthusiasm for gold is also visible \\nin investor positioning. While ETF holdings of \\ngold in volume terms actually declined in 2024, \\ntheir value in dollars reached an all-time high. \\nSimilarly, net speculative positioning in the futures \\nand options markets remains elevated, standing \\nin its 88th percentile since 1995. All told, global \\ninvestment demand accounted for about a quarter \\nof gold purchases through the third quarter of last \\nyear, roughly in line with long-run averages but \\nhigher than levels seen in 2021–23.\\n\\n\\nThe macroeconomic backdrop presents a \\nmore mixed outlook for gold. We forecast positive \\nbut falling real interest rates this year, which \\nhave historically been neutral for gold relative \\nto unconditional returns (see Exhibit 189). We \\nalso expect a modestly stronger dollar, which has \\nhistorically limited meaningful gold appreciation. \\nThat said, the reliability of both of these macro \\ndrivers has weakened in recent years, as discussed. \\n\\n\\nOn balance, these crosscurrents leave us neutral \\non gold prices from current levels. Central banks \\nhave been net buyers of gold for over a decade, \\nsuggesting their demand may be structural. \\nHowever, with gold already near all-time highs \\nand investors positioned for further upside, price \\nsensitivity among buyers is likely to increase.

      "**Document title: 2023 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"2023 Outlook\" document provides a comprehensive analysis of commodity markets, highlighting key trends and potential risks for the year ahead. The S&P GSCI demonstrated a robust performance with a 23% return last year, despite significant volatility throughout the year where returns peaked at 54% before halving. The report indicates a divergence in performance among commodities, with energy leading gains at 39%, largely due to backwardation, while industrial and precious metals faced losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document underscores the intricate balance between bullish supply-side and bearish demand-side pressures, influenced by factors like global economic slowdowns and uncertainties surrounding China's COVID policies. Despite low global inventories of commodities, the risk of supply disruptions remains pronounced, particularly in politically unstable regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the oil market, prices oscillated significantly due to geopolitical developments, surging to $124 per barrel before retreating below pre-war levels. Factors such as rising US production costs and OPEC's output constraints contribute to uncertainty. The forecast for WTI prices suggests a range of $70–100, though economic downturns or geopolitical stabilizations could push prices lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding gold, the document expresses skepticism about its role as a reliable hedge against inflation, noting that while demand from central banks and economic uncertainty could support prices, historical trends indicate lower returns in times of a strengthening US dollar. The overall recommendation for investors regarding gold is to maintain a neutral position until clearer opportunities arise.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "**Document title: 2024 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"2024 Outlook\" document updates the analysis of commodity markets, contrasting with the previous year's optimistic trends outlined in the \"2023 Outlook.\" It reports a notable decline in the GSCI by 9% in 2023, as opposed to the significant 23% gain in 2022. This downward trend affected energy, agricultural, and industrial metal sectors widely, marking a stark contrast to the previous period of broad commodity appreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A key dynamic discussed is the relationship between high prices and demand: the elevated commodity prices from 2022 led to demand conservation and supply enhancements, notably within the oil sector. While previous forecasts circulated about oil price surges post-Russian sanctions did not materialize—thanks to Russia's adaptive export strategies—production in the U.S. unexpectedly surged, showing a significant growth rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although uranium has emerged as a bright spot, with a 90% rally supporting a small overweight recommendation, gold's outlook for 2024 appears more challenging despite an impressive 13% return last year. The document notes that while past performance may seem favorable, factors influencing gold prices have shifted, reducing bullish sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the oil market, the document expresses cautious expectations, projecting WTI prices within a lower range of $60–80 by year-end, reflecting slower demand growth from last year. It highlights OPEC's dilemma in managing supply at historical lows and the increasing production from non-OPEC nations, emphasizing persistent geopolitical risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the 2024 Outlook demonstrates a cautious approach towards commodities, influenced by a mix of subdued market performance in 2023, the complexities of oil supply dynamics, and a more tempered view on gold, contrasting with the optimism of the 2023 document. The document maintains neutrality regarding direct investment strategies in oil and gold, suggesting a shift in strategic sentiment among investors compared to the previous year's outlook.\n",

      "**Document title: 2025 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"2025 Outlook\" document presents updates on commodity markets, reflecting a modest rebound after the losses observed in 2023. Compared to the \"2024 Outlook,\" which noted a 4% gain in the GSCI in 2024 along with uneven performance across subsectors, the new document highlights a continuation of trends shaped by geopolitical risks and supply-demand dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key similarities include a focus on the oil market's stability, with both documents projecting WTI crude prices to maintain a consistent range of $60–80—aligned with the previous year's cautious outlook. The previous document warned of geopolitical risks and moderating demand growth, a sentiment carried forward in the 2025 assessment detailing ongoing conflicts and the need for OPEC+ to manage oil supply amid robust spare capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, notable differences emerge in the performance of gold and overall commodities. In contrast to the cautious stance on gold from the 2024 analysis, which reflected shifting market dynamics, the 2025 document highlights gold’s extraordinary performance with a 27% increase, credited to factors like central bank purchases and geopolitical uncertainty. This demonstrates a reversal from last year's more tempered sentiment and reflects broader demand dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2025 document also discusses an anticipated increase in global oil demand driven by economic activity, differing from last year's projected stagnation in demand growth from major consumers like China. The focus on this projected increase accounts for expected supply growth primarily from non-OECD nations—also a continuation from the previous discussion on OPEC+ dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while the 2025 Outlook shares a broad continuation of cautious neutrality toward commodities established in earlier documents, it reflects more optimism regarding gold and outlines an evolving narrative concerning oil supply and demand dynamics. This marks a significant shift from the 2024 document's sentiments, particularly regarding the evolving factors impacting gold and oil forecasts.\n",

As seen in Exhibit 181, close \\nto 10% of global oil production found itself at \\nrisk of disruption virtually overnight in the wake \\nof Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing \\nrollout of Western sanctions. Given already low \\nglobal oil inventories and thin spare capacity, oil \\nprices understandably spiked higher, reaching $124 \\nat their peak closing level last March. \\n\\n\\nPrices have since fallen back below pre-war \\nlevels.

The full effect of European \\nsanctions on Russia will not be visible in energy \\nmarkets until the first quarter of this year. These \\ncurbs directly impact 0.5 million b/d of seaborne \\ncrude oil and 1.1 million b/d of refined products. \\nWhile Russia has so far been successful at \\nredirecting crude exports to India and China, this \\nstrategy is starting to show some limits (see Exhibit \\n182).

Instead, Russia successfully \\nredirected most of these sanctioned exports to \\nChina and India. Predictions of a slowdown in US \\nproduction growth also missed the mark, as US \\nproducers recorded their fastest growth rate since \\n2019. With these bullish catalysts not happening \\nthe way people thought they would, oil prices \\nended the year with a modest 11% loss.Oil begins the year trading at the lower end of \\nits annual range. However, this does not negate the \\npotential downside risks for 2024, as we anticipate \\nchallenges stemming from both demand and \\nsupply dynamics. Sustaining the recent demand \\ngrowth rate will be challenging now that the post-\\npandemic recovery has largely run its course. We \\npredict that demand growth will return to a trend-\\nlike pace of 1.0–1.5 million b/d this year in the \\nabsence of a recession, a significant deceleration \\nfrom last year’s 2.3 million b/d increase (see \\nExhibit 173).This slower demand growth will likely require \\nrestraint on the part of producers to keep the \\nmarket in balance. For their part, US producers \\nhave consistently demonstrated discipline in their \\nallocation of capital. Over the last 12 months, these \\nproducers have returned 49% of their cash flows \\nto investors compared to 37% per year between \\n2014 and 2019. However, productivity has also \\nimproved in recent years, such that the same dollar \\nof capital spending now generates more oil. As a \\nresult, US production is likely to continue growing \\ndespite ongoing capital discipline.The potential for output restraint among other \\nnon-OPEC producers is just as dubious. Brazil, \\nGuyana and Canada have all experienced a notable \\nuptick in their oil output recently. What’s \\nmore, their production is unlikely to be \\naffected by oil prices, as it stems from \\nyears of investment in offshore and oil \\nsands projects that are just now coming \\nonline. Ultimately, oil production from \\nthese projects could crowd out further \\nexpansion from US shale. \\nThe high prices of commodities \\ncoming into last year proved to be the \\nantidote for even higher prices.Against this backdrop, the burden of managing \\nsupply relative to demand rests with OPEC, where \\nthere is arguably little room for further reductions. \\nOPEC production already stands at 10-year lows \\nand has been higher than current levels 88% of \\nthe time in the past 20 years73 (see Exhibit 174). \\nSimilarly, the production of Saudi Arabia—often \\nconsidered the ultimate swing producer—has \\nseldom fallen below its current level. Going \\nforward, OPEC’s determination to support prices \\ncould be tested if further production cuts become \\nnecessary.

But \\nthat reputation was tarnished in 2022, as gold \\nprices spent most of the year trading in negative \\nterritory despite the highest inflation in four \\ndecades. This disappointing performance was \\nyet another reminder that gold is subject to a \\nmultitude of often opposing factors. Case in point: \\nthe impact of last year’s inflation surprise was \\nlargely offset by the combination of higher interest \\nrates and the surge in the US dollar, with which \\ngold tends to be negatively correlated.These types of crosscurrents leave us tactically \\nneutral on gold again this year. As seen in Exhibit \\n185, our expectation for softer nominal and \\nreal interest rates removes one of last year’s key \\nheadwinds to gold. Yet real rates are still likely \\nto remain in positive territory, which historically \\nhas resulted in lower-than-average gold returns \\n(see Exhibit 186). After all, positive interest rates \\ncreate an opportunity cost of holding gold, which \\ngenerates no cash flow or yield income and must \\nbe physically stored, often at a cost.We also do not see a compelling argument for \\ninvestors to replace their US dollar holdings with \\ngold this year, given our still constructive view on \\nthe currency. Consider that since 1971, there has \\nbeen only a 24% chance of a meaningful gold \\nrally of more than 10% in periods when the dollar \\nwas stable or rising. In fact, most meaningful \\ngold rallies have happened when the US dollar \\nwas depreciating. Put simply, when the dollar is \\nappreciating—a situation we expect this year—\\nthe low probability of strong gold returns has \\nnot historically justified the risk and volatility of \\nholding the yellow metal.Still, there are a few factors that could buoy \\ngold, not the least of which is a US recession that \\nmight rekindle demand for gold as a safe-haven \\nasset. Gold also stands to benefit if currently \\nunderweight investors increase their positions \\n(see Exhibit 187), which now stand 28% below \\ntheir recent peak in early 2022 and back at levels \\nlast seen in early 2020.

There is scope for \\ninvestors to increase their ETF exposure to gold, \\nas current positions are more than 25 million \\nounces below their 2020 peak (see Exhibit 177). \\nEmerging market central banks are also increasing \\ntheir exposure, as they continue to diversify some \\nof their reserves into gold. Based on data up to the \\nthird quarter of last year, these central banks added \\naround 1,000 tonnes of gold to their balance sheets \\nlast year, accounting for nearly 30% of global gold \\nproduction. However, this is not an incremental \\nsource of demand, as they purchased about the \\nsame amount the previous year (see Exhibit 178).As was the case last year, our expectation \\nfor lower nominal interest rates could also \\nbenefit gold. Recall that lower rates reduce the \\nopportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t \\nyield any income and needs to be stored, often \\nat a cost. This interest rate dynamic can also be \\nindirectly observed through gold’s positive reaction \\nto past Federal Reserve rate cuts. In fact, in the six \\nmonths following the first rate cut of a cycle, gold \\nprices have rallied 60% of the time, by a median of \\n6.2% (see Exhibit 179).However, the fact that disinflation is pushing \\ninterest rates lower could weaken this dynamic. That \\nhas been the case historically, as real interest rates \\nhave been a more important driver of gold prices \\nthan nominal interest rates. Falling but positive real \\nrates, which we expect this year, have historically \\nbeen roughly neutral for gold prices compared to \\ntheir unconditional performance.

While there is a negative \\ncorrelation between gold and the \\ndollar, it has historically taken a large \\ndollar depreciation to push gold prices \\nmeaningfully higher, which is not our \\ncentral case.

      "The 2023 Outlook highlights the strong performance of commodities in the previous year, with the S&P GSCI returning 23%, outperforming other asset classes for the second straight year. However, this overall gain hid a more complex situation, as returns peaked at 54% by June before being cut in half by year-end. There was considerable variation among individual commodities; while energy gained 39% primarily due to positive carry from backwardation, industrial and precious metals experienced losses.

      "The 2024 Outlook presents a stark contrast to the previous year's strong commodity performance, reporting a decline of 9% in the GSCI for 2023. This downturn reverses the two-year trend of positive returns, highlighting widespread negative performance across energy, agriculture, and industrial metals. The document emphasizes that high commodity prices from previous years led to demand conservation and increased supply capacity, particularly in oil production, which may limit price increases moving forward. Notably, uranium exhibited exceptional growth with a 90% rally, leading to a recommended overweight position in uranium investments due to ongoing supply-demand imbalances. Conversely, gold’s performance was robust with a 13% return; however, its outlook for 2024 appears less favorable due to peak pricing and a mixed fundamental landscape.\n",

      "The 2025 Outlook offers a mixed assessment of the commodity markets, reflecting a modest recovery from the previous year's struggles, with a reported 4% return in the GSCI for 2024. This rebound contrasts with the 9% decline in 2023 but indicates considerable unevenness, as gains in precious metals and livestock could not compensate for losses in agriculture and industrial metals. The previous year's relative price stability in energy persists, bolstered by a historically high spare capacity in oil markets, despite ongoing geopolitical tensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold, as a key highlight, achieved a remarkable 27% return in 2024, surpassing all other commodities and even outperforming the S&P 500. This growth stemmed from significant central bank purchases, monetary easing, and heightened geopolitical risks, amidst challenges like rising real interest rates and a stronger US dollar. Unlike the previous document’s cautious outlook on gold due to peak pricing dynamics, this 2025 report advocates a small overweight in the US midstream sector for its robust cash flows and resilience against oil price fluctuations, reflecting a more strategic investment position.\n",

After two years of strong performance in the commodities market, the GSCI experienced a notable decline of 9% in 2023, reversing the previous trend of growth. Unlike 2022's broad-based gains, losses were pervasive across energy, agriculture, and industrial metals.

After a tumultuous 2023, the GSCI experienced a modest 4% return in 2024, characterized by uneven performance across sectors—gains in precious metals and livestock countered by losses in agriculture and industrial metals, contrasting with 2023's overall downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like in previous years, geopolitical tensions and rising inflation continue to influence market dynamics, yet energy prices remained relatively stable, attributed to historically high spare capacity in oil markets. This setting reflects a cautious optimism, forecasting steady global economic growth to sustain demand while ample spare capacity is expected to restrain price surges without significant distress in supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold emerged as a particularly strong performer, achieving a 27% return—the highest in a decade—and surpassing the performance of the S&P 500.

      "The document analyzes the current state of global commodities, noting low inventories despite weak demand from China, which suggests similar weakness in supply. This thin inventory situation increases price sensitivity to supply disruptions in politically unstable regions, particularly in South America for base metals and Russia and the Middle East for oil. The outlook for industrial metals and oil prices appears balanced but carries risks due to potential factors like a US recession or ongoing global COVID-19 issues. Specifically for oil, WTI prices are expected to range between $70 and $100 by year-end, though prices could drop to $60 under certain adverse conditions. However, such lower prices are not expected to persist due to producers’ likely reactions. Upside risks remain if additional supply disruptions occur, driven by low inventories. The document also suggests an overweight position in the US midstream sector due to stable cash flows and reduced exposure to oil price volatility.\n",
      "**New Document Title: 2024 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Document Summary:**\n",
      "The 2024 Outlook updates the previous analysis of global commodities by adjusting the expected WTI oil price range to $60–80 by year-end, reflecting diminished upside potential compared to the $70–100 forecast in the 2023 Outlook. The document highlights several risks, including increasing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and instability in nations like Libya and Nigeria, contributing to potential supply disruptions. Notably, oil production outages, excluding Russia, are at their lowest in a decade. Although temporary price spikes may occur due to OPEC's spare capacity, the prospect for sustained high prices remains low, echoing concerns raised previously about a potential US recession and OPEC's production discipline. Despite these challenges, a small overweight position in the US midstream sector is still advised, emphasizing stable cash flows and reduced oil price volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, unlike the previous document, this one introduces a new focus on gold as an investment asset, noting its unprecedented price peak of $2,077 in December, which has fueled optimism for future growth. Factors such as central banks' de-dollarization, declining interest rates, and a shift towards safe-haven assets amid global uncertainties are deemed bull catalysts for gold, enhancing the document’s investment perspective. Overall, while there are continuities in oil market forecasts and investment recommendations, the inclusion of gold signifies a notable expansion in focus from the prior document.\n",

      "\n",
      "In terms of oil, the document highlights an unusual stability in 2024, with WTI crude oil prices remaining mostly flat within a tighter trading range of $60–80—this consistency contrasts sharply with the previous document's expectations of volatile price movements stimulated by geopolitical risks. Despite the forecasted price stability for 2025, which remains unchanged from the 2024 estimate, the report brings attention to key risks such as low global oil inventories and potential lapses in OPEC+ production discipline, echoing previous concerns but with more emphasis on market balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "A notable shift in focus is the anticipation of potential policy changes under the incoming Trump administration, which may influence sanctions and domestic energy pricing. Unlike the previous document that introduced gold as a significant investment opportunity, this summary does not extend its portfolio beyond uranium and oil, suggesting a narrow scope in comparison.

      "The 2023 Outlook highlights a complex interplay between bullish supply-side factors and bearish demand-side concerns affecting commodity prices. Key points include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The potential for a global economic slowdown, particularly due to uncertainties regarding China's economy and its COVID policies, may undermine demand for commodities despite years of underinvestment supporting prices.\n",
      "- Oil prices experienced volatility in the past year, influenced heavily by geopolitical events, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which put a significant portion of global oil production at risk. Prices peaked at $124 but have since fallen below pre-war levels due to a combination of factors, including a record release of oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve and reduced Chinese demand.\n",
      "- The anticipated effects of European sanctions on Russian oil supplies are expected to impact the market in the first quarter, with nearly 2 million barrels per day still at risk of disruption.\n",
      "- Despite lower prices, the risk of supply shocks remains, particularly within the context of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and instability in other oil-exporting nations.\n",
      "- Demand risks are heightened by the prospects of a recession in the US and uncertainties surrounding China's economic reopening. While global demand is projected to exceed pre-COVID levels by year-end, it hinges on US production growth to meet the increase.\n",
      "- US producers face challenges in ramping up output due to high costs and capital discipline, while OPEC's production levels are already at pre-COVID output. A downturn in oil prices could lead to reduced production growth and drilling activity.\n",
      "**New Document Title:** 2024 Outlook\n",
      "\n",
      "**New Document Summary:**\n",
      "The 2024 Outlook shifts the focus of oil market dynamics, emphasizing unexpected outcomes from last year and setting the stage for ongoing challenges in demand and supply. Key points include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Contrary to prior expectations, oil prices did not surge due to Russian sanctions; instead, Russia managed to reroute sanctioned oil exports primarily to China and India, resulting in a modest overall decline in oil prices of 11% throughout the year.\n",
      "- Predictions of a slowdown in US production growth were also incorrect, as US producers achieved their fastest growth rate since 2019, largely supported by enhanced productivity.\n",
      "- The anticipated demand growth for 2024 is expected to decelerate significantly to 1.0–1.5 million b/d due to the saturation of post-pandemic recovery. This creates a need for producer restraint to balance the market, despite US producers' recent track record of returning a larger percentage of their cash flows to investors.\n",
      "- Non-OPEC countries, particularly Brazil, Guyana, and Canada, are likely to continue boosting oil output without being overly sensitive to oil prices, raising concerns about this new production potentially overshadowing US shale expansion.\n",
      "- OPEC's role in managing supply has become more challenging, with production levels already at 10-year lows and internal divisions emerging around production cuts, highlighted by Angola's recent exit from the organization in protest.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Comparison to the 2023 Outlook:**\n",
      "- **Similarities:** Both documents address the global oil market's interplay of supply and demand factors, emphasizing uncertainties fueled by geopolitical tensions, particularly related to Russia and production challenges. Both highlight the importance of US production levels in global contexts, with a shared focus on the repercussions of production discipline among US producers.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Differences:** The 2024 Outlook introduces a retrospective view of last year's unforeseen outcomes, contrasting the prior expectation of skyrocketing prices with flat trajectory results. It highlights new dynamics from non-OECD oil producers driving output growth, differing from the previous findings where the focus was primarily on OPEC behavior and an impending supply shock. Additionally, it anticipates a significant deceleration in demand growth, unlike the 2023 Outlook’s projection of demand exceeding pre-COVID levels reliant on US production growth.\n",
      "**New Document Title:** 2025 Outlook\n",
      "\n",
      "**New Document Summary:**\n",
      "The 2025 Outlook builds upon previous assessments of the oil market while introducing new dynamics influenced by global events. Key highlights include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Despite ongoing military conflicts in the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war, supply disruptions have remained modest due to OPEC+'s strict adherence to production cut agreements, which have been extended through 2026. This discipline has resulted in historically high spare capacity that can buffer against sudden supply shocks.\n",
      "- Global oil demand growth has continued to slow for the third consecutive year, yet consumption has reached an all-time high as it recovers from pandemic distortions. Future demand is projected to grow by around 1 million b/d, with specific expectations that Chinese demand growth will significantly lag at approximately 0.1–0.2 million b/d due to slower economic growth and a shift in transportation preferences. This trend reflects an ongoing pattern from 2024, where China’s growth was eclipsed by India's.\n",
      "- The anticipated increase in oil supply is expected to primarily stem from non-OECD countries, maintaining their role as the majority contributors to global oil output. A projected supply growth of about 1.2 million b/d from nations like the US, Guyana, Brazil, and Canada will be adequate to meet global demand, mainly driven by large offshore developments that are less affected by fluctuating oil prices.\n",
      "- OPEC+'s role in supply management continues to be pivotal. However, the organization is expected to maintain ample spare capacity while managing the balance between supply and demand, adjusting its discipline only if prices rise sustainably.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Comparison to the 2024 Outlook:**\n",
      "- **Similarities:** Both documents address the complex dynamics of global oil supply and demand, with a focus on OPEC+'s production discipline and its implications for market stability. Both also highlight the slower growth of oil demand, emphasizing the shift in demand patterns from major markets like China and India.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Differences:** The 2025 Outlook reflects an extension of OPEC+'s production cuts into 2026, contrasting the previous document's emphasis on challenges in maintaining compliance amid market pressures. It also notes a more pronounced recovery in global consumption compared to 2024, though growth remains subdued specifically in China. While the 2024 Outlook acknowledged non-OPEC countries' output growth, the 2025 document underscores their increasing significance to global oil supply, suggesting a shift in the landscape whereby non-OECD producers play a crucial role in meeting future demand, thereby altering the narrative around OPEC+'s influence.\n",

      "The document discusses the status of gold as an investment in the context of economic conditions, specifically inflation and interest rates. Despite being considered a hedge against inflation, gold's performance in 2022 was disappointing, largely due to rising interest rates and a strong US dollar, which negatively impacted its price. The authors remain tactically neutral on gold for 2023, noting that although expected softer interest rates might alleviate some previous pressures on gold, real interest rates are likely to stay positive, which historically leads to lower gold returns. The document highlights that it does not see strong justification for replacing US dollar holdings with gold this year, given the low likelihood of substantial gold price increases when the dollar is stable or appreciating. However, potential demand for gold could arise from a US recession, increased positions by underweight investors, and purchases by emerging market central banks seeking to diversify their reserves. In summary, the document concludes with a neutral outlook on gold until more positive signals emerge.\n",
      "**2024 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "The new document, \"2024 Outlook,\" builds upon the insights from the previous document, \"2023 Outlook,\" but presents some updated perspectives on gold as an investment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Key similarities include the core theme of maintaining a neutral outlook on gold, as well as the recognition of economic factors such as interest rates and inflation that influence its value. Like its predecessor, the 2024 document references the impact of rising interest rates and the US dollar on gold prices, echoing concerns from 2023 about the potential limitations on gold's performance when the dollar is strong or stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are marked differences in the new document's analysis. It notes a significant rally in gold prices at the end of last year, alongside a wider market rally, indicating a more dynamic market scenario than previously assessed. The newer document highlights the potential for increased ETF investment in gold, a trend not mentioned in the first document, while still recognizing that central bank purchases are not a significant new source of demand compared to the previous year. Additionally, the updated outlook gives more weight to the influence of disinflation on real interest rates and gold prices, arguing that current conditions may lead to more neutral gold performance despite favorable nominal interest rate expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while both documents reflect a cautious approach to gold investment due to existing economic conditions, the 2024 Outlook introduces new trends and dynamics, particularly concerning market performance and central bank activity, ultimately maintaining a similar neutral stance pending clearer investment opportunities.\n",

Both documents acknowledge that rising real interest rates and a strong dollar can limit gold's appreciation, continuing the cautious approach towards gold investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, significant differences highlight the changing dynamics in the market. The 2025 Outlook emphasizes a substantial increase in central bank gold purchases, particularly from countries like China, India, and Türkiye, driven by diversification strategies and geopolitical tensions—trends that were less pronounced in the 2024 analysis. Gold purchases topped 1,000 tonnes in 2022-23, indicating a more robust demand compared to previous years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, despite a decline in ETF volume holdings in 2024, their dollar value peaked, contrasting with the 2024 document, which noted a potential for increased ETF investment in gold without similar focus on value dynamics. The new document also emphasizes that investment demand accounted for a quarter of gold purchases, slightly above long-run averages, while maintaining that price sensitivity among buyers is likely to increase due to high price levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while both reports advocate for a neutral outlook on gold investment, the 2025 document underscores a stronger structural demand from central banks and a more complex interplay of macroeconomic factors, reflecting the evolving dynamics of gold investment in a shifting geopolitical context.\n",
