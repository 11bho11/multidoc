       "[Document(id='2023 Outlook', metadata={}, page_content='Commodities were a bright spot for markets last \\nyear (see Exhibit 180). The S&P GSCI returned \\n23%, topping all other major asset classes for a \\nsecond consecutive year. But this impressive gain \\nbelied a more nuanced reality, as returns reached \\n54% by early June, only to be halved in the \\nsecond half of the year. Investors also faced a wide \\ndispersion among individual commodities and their \\nsource of returns. In contrast to the index’s overall \\nstrength, both industrial metals and precious \\nmetals suffered losses last year. And while the \\nenergy subindex outperformed with a 39% gain, \\nthe bulk of this came from positive carry, or the \\nadditional return holders of a commodity get when \\nthe futures curve is strongly downward sloping, \\ncalled “backwardation.” The appreciation in spot \\nenergy prices was a much smaller 14%.  \\n\\n\\nThe disjointed nature of these returns reflects \\nthe tug-of-war between bullish supply-side \\npressures and bearish demand-side concerns that is \\nlikely to continue in the year ahead. Although years \\nof underinvestment are an underlying support for \\nmany commodity prices, a deeper global economic \\nslowdown could quickly undermine demand, \\nespecially given the still-uncertain trajectory of \\nChina’s economy amid its shifting COVID policies. \\n\\n\\nAgainst these risks, we note that global \\ninventories have remained low across most \\ncommodities despite months of weak Chinese \\ndemand—a sign of equally weak supply trends. A \\nthinner inventory buffer also leaves prices sensitive \\nto potential supply disruptions in politically \\nunstable areas, such as South America for base \\nmetals, or—discussed further below—Russia and \\nthe Middle East for oil. Given these crosscurrents, \\nwe believe that risks around our base case are \\nroughly balanced for industrial metals and oil \\nprices this year. As for gold, we remain doubtful \\nabout its ability to provide investors with a reliable \\nhedge against inflation or political risk given its \\nnotable failure to do so in the past year.  \\n\\n\\nOil: High Risks, Low Inventories\\nOil prices last year were driven by geopolitical \\ndevelopments to a degree not seen since the \\nturbulent 1970s. As seen in Exhibit 181, close \\nto 10% of global oil production found itself at \\nrisk of disruption virtually overnight in the wake \\nof Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing \\nrollout of Western sanctions. Given already low \\nglobal oil inventories and thin spare capacity, oil \\nprices understandably spiked higher, reaching $124 \\nat their peak closing level last March. \\n\\n\\nPrices have since fallen back below pre-war \\nlevels. This surprising retracement reflects not only \\nthe failure of supply risks to materialize, but also \\na combination of bearish developments, including \\nan unprecedented 200-million-barrel release from \\nthe US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a COVID-\\ndriven slump in Chinese oil demand and fears of \\nan impending recession. \\n\\n\\nAlthough oil prices have receded, the bullish \\nrisks that underpinned their initial spike higher \\nhave not disappeared. The full effect of European \\nsanctions on Russia will not be visible in energy \\nmarkets until the first quarter of this year. These \\ncurbs directly impact 0.5 million b/d of seaborne \\ncrude oil and 1.1 million b/d of refined products. \\nWhile Russia has so far been successful at \\nredirecting crude exports to India and China, this \\nstrategy is starting to show some limits (see Exhibit \\n182). Moreover, it will be difficult for Russia to \\nreplicate this strategy in refined products, as both \\nChina and India were net exporters in this category \\nlast year.\\n\\n\\nAs a result, close to 2 million b/d of Russian \\nsupplies to Europe remain at risk. Consensus \\ncurrently expects a net loss of less than half that \\namount, increasing the risk of an upside surprise. \\nUpward pressure on energy prices could also \\narise from supply disruptions in other countries, \\ngiven geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and \\ndomestic instability in Libya and other exporting \\ncountries.  \\n\\n\\nTo be sure, the demand for oil faces an equally \\nhigh degree of risk amid a potential US recession and \\nthe still-uncertain trajectory of China’s economy. We \\nestimate that Chinese demand fell by 0.5 million b/d \\non average last year, marking the first annual decline \\nsince 1990 (see Exhibit 183). While a successful \\nreopening of China’s economy could help offset \\nweaker oil demand elsewhere, a more protracted \\nCOVID wave could exacerbate demand concerns. \\nFor now, we expect global demand to remain on an \\nupward trajectory in our base case, exceeding pre-\\nCOVID levels by year-end.  \\n\\n\\nMeeting this demand will require continuing \\ngrowth from US producers, as OPEC has already \\nramped its output back to pre-COVID levels \\nand has limited spare capacity. But to incentivize \\nadditional drilling, oil prices must remain high \\nenough to overcome the cost inflation and self-\\nimposed capital discipline now holding back \\nUS production. In contrast, lower prices and \\ndisappointing demand would likely restrain \\nproduction growth. Tellingly, the November and \\nDecember oil price slump was rapidly followed by \\na decline in US drilling and completion activity, \\nwhile OPEC immediately announced a production \\ncut to rescue prices. \\n\\n\\nGiven these moving pieces, we expect WTI \\nprices to trade in a $70–100 range by year-end, \\nwhich would imply upside from current levels. \\nBut we are mindful of the many risks that could \\nundermine this forecast—including a US recession, \\nanother wave of global COVID infections or a \\nquick resolution to the conflict in Ukraine—any \\none of which could push prices down to cost \\nsupport near $60. That said, we would not expect \\nthese lower prices to be sustained for an extended \\nperiod, given producers’ likely reaction. There are \\nalso upside risks. Any additional supply disruptions \\nwould be magnified by still-low inventories, which could push prices above our \\nforecast range, as happened last year. \\n\\n\\nAlthough we do not have an active tactical \\nallocation to oil, we do continue to recommend \\na small overweight to the US midstream sector, \\nwhich benefits from strong cash flows and less \\ndirect exposure to oil price volatility.\\n\\n\\nGold: Not as Advertised\\nSince its meteoric rise in the 1970s, gold has been \\nhailed as an effective hedge against inflation. But \\nthat reputation was tarnished in 2022, as gold \\nprices spent most of the year trading in negative \\nterritory despite the highest inflation in four \\ndecades. This disappointing performance was \\nyet another reminder that gold is subject to a \\nmultitude of often opposing factors. Case in point: \\nthe impact of last year’s inflation surprise was \\nlargely offset by the combination of higher interest \\nrates and the surge in the US dollar, with which \\ngold tends to be negatively correlated.\\n\\n\\nThese types of crosscurrents leave us tactically \\nneutral on gold again this year. As seen in Exhibit \\n185, our expectation for softer nominal and \\nreal interest rates removes one of last year’s key \\nheadwinds to gold. Yet real rates are still likely \\nto remain in positive territory, which historically \\nhas resulted in lower-than-average gold returns \\n(see Exhibit 186). After all, positive interest rates \\ncreate an opportunity cost of holding gold, which \\ngenerates no cash flow or yield income and must \\nbe physically stored, often at a cost. \\n\\n\\nWe also do not see a compelling argument for \\ninvestors to replace their US dollar holdings with \\ngold this year, given our still constructive view on \\nthe currency. Consider that since 1971, there has \\nbeen only a 24% chance of a meaningful gold \\nrally of more than 10% in periods when the dollar \\nwas stable or rising. In fact, most meaningful \\ngold rallies have happened when the US dollar \\nwas depreciating. Put simply, when the dollar is \\nappreciating—a situation we expect this year—\\nthe low probability of strong gold returns has \\nnot historically justified the risk and volatility of \\nholding the yellow metal.   \\n\\n\\nStill, there are a few factors that could buoy \\ngold, not the least of which is a US recession that \\nmight rekindle demand for gold as a safe-haven \\nasset. Gold also stands to benefit if currently \\nunderweight investors increase their positions \\n(see Exhibit 187), which now stand 28% below \\ntheir recent peak in early 2022 and back at levels \\nlast seen in early 2020. Demand from EM central \\nbanks looking to diversify their FX reserves into \\ngold is another source of upside risk. The latest \\ndata from the World Gold Council already points \\nto record-high purchases in the most recent \\nquarter, with countries such as Turkey, China and \\nIndia leading the pack. Further geopolitical strife \\ncould even accelerate this trend.  \\n\\n\\nGiven these contradictory factors, we remain \\nneutral on gold until a clearer opportunity \\npresents itself. '),\n",
       " Document(id='2024 Outlook', metadata={}, page_content='Last year reminded commodity investors that it’s \\nnever wise to count chickens before they hatch. \\nFollowing two years of strong performance that \\nhad reinforced investors’ belief in a new supercycle, \\nthe GSCI instead fell 9% in 2023 (see Exhibit \\n172). The losses were broad-based, with negative \\nprice performance across energy, agriculture and \\nindustrial metals.  \\n\\n\\nThe high prices of commodities coming into \\nlast year proved to be the antidote for even higher \\nprices, as they incentivized a mix of demand \\nconservation, investment in supply capacity and \\nproductivity improvements. This dynamic was \\nparticularly visible in the oil patch last year, where \\nproduction exceeded expectations in several \\ncountries despite producers’ capital discipline. The \\nresulting spare capacity is likely to limit upside \\nagain this year, barring major supply disruptions.   \\n\\n\\nOutside of commonly traded commodity \\nindices, there were a couple bright spots. Uranium \\nsaw a strong rally, gaining 90% last year. We \\ncontinue to recommend a small overweight to \\nuranium, a position we initiated in March 2022 \\nbased on our view that the widening gap between \\nsupply and demand would push prices higher. With \\nsupply being slow to respond despite last year’s \\nrally, we expect uranium prices to rise further \\nthis year. \\n\\n\\nGold also stood out last year, posting a 13% \\nreturn. However, we think the backdrop for gold is \\nmore challenging in 2024, given near-record prices \\nand a more mixed fundamental outlook. \\n\\n\\nOil: Threading the Needle\\n“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into \\ntrouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t \\nso.” That quote, often attributed to Mark Twain, \\nproved apt for oil investors last year, as some \\nwidely expected developments failed to materialize. \\nThe almost universal expectation that oil prices \\nwould surge due to Russian sanctions limiting \\nsupply did not occur. Instead, Russia successfully \\nredirected most of these sanctioned exports to \\nChina and India. Predictions of a slowdown in US \\nproduction growth also missed the mark, as US \\nproducers recorded their fastest growth rate since \\n2019. With these bullish catalysts not happening \\nthe way people thought they would, oil prices \\nended the year with a modest 11% loss.\\n\\n\\nOil begins the year trading at the lower end of \\nits annual range. However, this does not negate the \\npotential downside risks for 2024, as we anticipate \\nchallenges stemming from both demand and \\nsupply dynamics. Sustaining the recent demand \\ngrowth rate will be challenging now that the post-\\npandemic recovery has largely run its course. We \\npredict that demand growth will return to a trend-\\nlike pace of 1.0–1.5 million b/d this year in the \\nabsence of a recession, a significant deceleration \\nfrom last year’s 2.3 million b/d increase (see \\nExhibit 173).\\n\\n\\nThis slower demand growth will likely require \\nrestraint on the part of producers to keep the \\nmarket in balance. For their part, US producers \\nhave consistently demonstrated discipline in their \\nallocation of capital. Over the last 12 months, these \\nproducers have returned 49% of their cash flows \\nto investors compared to 37% per year between \\n2014 and 2019. However, productivity has also \\nimproved in recent years, such that the same dollar \\nof capital spending now generates more oil. As a \\nresult, US production is likely to continue growing \\ndespite ongoing capital discipline. \\n\\n\\nThe potential for output restraint among other \\nnon-OPEC producers is just as dubious. Brazil, \\nGuyana and Canada have all experienced a notable \\nuptick in their oil output recently. What’s \\nmore, their production is unlikely to be \\naffected by oil prices, as it stems from \\nyears of investment in offshore and oil \\nsands projects that are just now coming \\nonline. Ultimately, oil production from \\nthese projects could crowd out further \\nexpansion from US shale. \\nThe high prices of commodities \\ncoming into last year proved to be the \\nantidote for even higher prices.\\n\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, the burden of managing \\nsupply relative to demand rests with OPEC, where \\nthere is arguably little room for further reductions. \\nOPEC production already stands at 10-year lows \\nand has been higher than current levels 88% of \\nthe time in the past 20 years73 (see Exhibit 174). \\nSimilarly, the production of Saudi Arabia—often \\nconsidered the ultimate swing producer—has \\nseldom fallen below its current level. Going \\nforward, OPEC’s determination to support prices \\ncould be tested if further production cuts become \\nnecessary. Indeed, at OPEC’s November 2023 \\nmeeting, the decision to further reduce production \\nsparked internal disagreements, leading to Angola’s \\nexit from the organization in protest.\\n\\n\\nConsidering these challenges, we expect WTI \\nprices to trade in a $60–80 range by year-end, \\nimplying minimal upside from current levels. That \\nsaid, we are mindful of several risks that could \\npotentially undermine our forecast. The likelihood \\nof supply disruptions is growing given prevalent \\ngeopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East, as well \\nas instability in countries like Libya and Nigeria. \\nAt the same time, global oil production outages \\nexcluding Russia currently stand near their lowest \\nlevel in 10 years (see Exhibit 175).  While any price \\nspike would likely be temporary given OPEC’s \\nhistorically high spare capacity (see Exhibit 176), \\na spike could still cause significant disruptions in \\nthe short term. There are also legitimate downside \\nrisks to oil prices, including a US recession, an \\nabrupt reversal of OPEC cuts or even a lack of \\nproduction discipline among OPEC members. \\n\\n\\nIn light of these various crosscurrents, we \\ndo not have an active tactical allocation to oil. \\nHowever, we continue to recommend a small \\noverweight position to the US midstream sector, \\nwhich benefits from strong cash flows, growing \\nvolumes and less direct exposure to oil price \\nvolatility.   \\n\\n\\nGold: Breakout Mania\\nThere is nothing quite as captivating to investors as \\na new all-time high—like that reached by gold in \\nlate December last year, when its price hit $2,077. \\nThis milestone not only fueled expectations for \\nfurther gains, but also reinforced investors’ faith \\nin several bullish catalysts for gold. These included \\nso-called de-dollarization of central banks’ \\nreserves, falling interest rates and investors’ search \\nfor safe-haven assets in times of global uncertainty. \\n\\n\\nBut as investors, we must avoid fitting a \\nnarrative to an asset’s price movements. Gold \\ndid indeed rally alongside bonds late last year, \\nbut the catalyst for the bond move was signs \\nof moderating inflation—whereas gold has the \\nreputation of being an inflation hedge. Moreover, \\nmost assets rallied during last year’s fourth quarter: \\ngold’s 11.6% return was similar to the 11.7% \\ngain of US equities but higher than the 6.8% \\nadvance of the US aggregate bond index. It is also \\nworth highlighting that this isn’t gold’s first time \\nsurpassing $2,000. In fact, it also exceeded this \\nlevel in August 2020 and March 2022, but reversed \\ncourse shortly after on both occasions. \\n\\n\\nFor the year ahead, we see several crosscurrents \\nimpacting the outlook for gold. To be sure, gold \\nhas a few supportive factors. There is scope for \\ninvestors to increase their ETF exposure to gold, \\nas current positions are more than 25 million \\nounces below their 2020 peak (see Exhibit 177). \\nEmerging market central banks are also increasing \\ntheir exposure, as they continue to diversify some \\nof their reserves into gold. Based on data up to the \\nthird quarter of last year, these central banks added \\naround 1,000 tonnes of gold to their balance sheets \\nlast year, accounting for nearly 30% of global gold \\nproduction. However, this is not an incremental \\nsource of demand, as they purchased about the \\nsame amount the previous year (see Exhibit 178). \\n\\n\\nAs was the case last year, our expectation \\nfor lower nominal interest rates could also \\nbenefit gold. Recall that lower rates reduce the \\nopportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t \\nyield any income and needs to be stored, often \\nat a cost. This interest rate dynamic can also be \\nindirectly observed through gold’s positive reaction \\nto past Federal Reserve rate cuts. In fact, in the six \\nmonths following the first rate cut of a cycle, gold \\nprices have rallied 60% of the time, by a median of \\n6.2% (see Exhibit 179). \\n\\n\\nHowever, the fact that disinflation is pushing \\ninterest rates lower could weaken this dynamic. That \\nhas been the case historically, as real interest rates \\nhave been a more important driver of gold prices \\nthan nominal interest rates. Falling but positive real \\nrates, which we expect this year, have historically \\nbeen roughly neutral for gold prices compared to \\ntheir unconditional performance. Capitalizing on \\nthese rate movements also requires precise timing, as \\nthe median gold return in the six months before the \\nfirst Federal Reserve rate cut has been a 1.9% loss, \\nwith only a 50% chance of a gain. \\n\\n\\nWe do not expect the US dollar \\nto provide a clear catalyst to gold \\nprices either. While there is a negative \\ncorrelation between gold and the \\ndollar, it has historically taken a large \\ndollar depreciation to push gold prices \\nmeaningfully higher, which is not our \\ncentral case. In fact, we expect the dollar \\nto appreciate this year. \\nThere is nothing quite as captivating \\nto investors as a new all-time high—\\nlike that reached by gold in late \\nDecember last year.\\n\\n\\nIn short, we do not believe these conflicting \\nfactors convincingly justify today’s already high \\ngold prices, leaving us neutral until a clearer \\nopportunity presents itself.

       " Document(id='2025 Outlook', metadata={}, page_content='Commodity markets often change the locks just \\nwhen investors think they have found the keys. \\nRecent years have been no exception: investors \\ngained confidence after two consecutive years of \\nexcess returns in 2021 and 2022—fueled by supply \\nchain disruptions, rising inflation and Russia’s \\ninvasion of Ukraine—only to be caught off guard \\nby losses in 2023 and just a modest rebound last \\nyear. The GSCI’s 4% return in 2024 also masked \\nuneven performance across subsectors. Gains in \\nprecious metals and livestock weren’t enough to \\noffset losses in agriculture and industrial metals.\\n\\n\\nThe relative stability in energy prices last year \\nstood in stark contrast to pervasive geopolitical \\nrisks and moderating demand growth. This \\nresilience reflected historically high spare capacity \\nin oil markets, which helped balance declining \\ninventories and modest periodic disruptions. \\nLooking ahead, we expect steady global economic \\ngrowth to support demand, while ample spare \\ncapacity should again keep prices in check, barring \\na major supply disruption.\\n\\n\\nGold emerged as a standout performer last \\nyear, reaching a new all-time high in October and \\noutperforming the S&P 500 with a 27% spot \\nreturn. Its strength was driven by a combination of \\nfactors, including elevated central bank purchases, \\nmonetary easing, rising national debt concerns and \\ngeopolitical risks.\\n\\n\\nWhile we remain neutral on commodities \\noverall, we continue to recommend a small \\noverweight to uranium, which we believe offers \\nattractive asymmetry given an ongoing structural \\ndeficit (see Section I, Our Tactical Tilts).\\n\\n\\nOil: Uneasy Equilibrium\\nOil did not live up to its reputation for volatility \\nin 2024. Prices traded within their tightest range \\nsince 2013 in percentage terms and within their \\nnarrowest range since 1998 in real dollar terms. \\nWTI crude oil spent nearly 80% of 2024 within \\nour expected trading range of $60–80 and ended \\nthe year flat. This uncharacteristic stability reflected \\na balanced oil market, where ample spare capacity, \\ndisciplined production and moderating demand \\ngrowth combined to offset geopolitical risks.  \\n\\n\\nSupply disruptions remained modest despite \\nactive military conflicts in the Middle East \\nand Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. OPEC+ \\nmaintained remarkable discipline, extending \\nproduction cut agreements through 2026 and \\npostponing plans to unwind cuts. This resulted \\nin historically high spare capacity, providing a \\nbuffer against unexpected supply shocks (see \\nExhibit 183). Meanwhile, global oil demand \\ngrowth slowed for a third straight year, even as \\nconsumption demand recovered from pandemic \\ndistortions and reached a new all-time high.\\n\\n\\nLooking ahead to 2025, we expect trend-like \\nglobal economic activity to drive oil demand \\nhigher by around 1 million b/d, similar to last \\nyear. However, Chinese demand growth is likely to \\nremain subdued at around 0.1–0.2 million b/d due \\nto its slower economic growth (see Section II) and \\na shift away from petroleum-consuming passenger \\nand freight transportation vehicles. This would \\nleave China’s demand growth trailing India’s for a \\nsecond year (see Exhibit 184).\\n\\n\\nTo keep the market in balance, oil supply will \\nneed to increase to meet demand growth. Increased \\noil production is most likely to come from among \\nnon-OPEC+ countries, which now contribute the \\nmajority of global oil supply (see Exhibit 185). \\nIndeed, the approximately 1.2 million b/d in supply \\ngrowth we expect from countries such as the US, \\nGuyana, Brazil and Canada is sufficient to satisfy \\nglobal demand growth on its own. Moreover, much \\nof this expected growth arises from large-scale \\noffshore developments whose production is not \\nsensitive to market oil prices. \\n\\n\\nGiven this non-OPEC+ growth, the burden of \\nmanaging supply relative to demand rests with \\nOPEC+. We expect the group to maintain its recent \\nsupply discipline this year unless prices move \\nsustainably higher. This should ensure ample spare \\ncapacity to absorb unexpected disruptions. \\n\\n\\nGiven a roughly balanced oil market, we \\nexpect WTI crude oil prices to end 2025 in a range \\nof $60–80, consistent with the current forward \\ncurve and last year’s range. That said, risks to our \\noutlook remain. OPEC’s spare capacity provides a \\ntangible buffer, but the oil market’s other buffer—\\nobservable global oil inventories—is near multiyear \\nlows (see Exhibit 186). Additionally, OPEC+ could \\nchoose not to respond swiftly to a supply shock, \\nwhile weaker global demand, a lapse in OPEC+ \\nproduction discipline and larger-than-expected \\nnon-OPEC+ production growth could also test \\nmarket stability. \\n\\n\\nPolicy uncertainty also looms. The incoming \\nTrump administration may tighten sanctions on \\nIran, Russia and Venezuela, but is likely to prioritize \\nlow energy prices—balancing geopolitical objectives \\nwith domestic economic considerations. Meanwhile, \\nwhile deregulation could increase oil drilling \\npermits, logistical bottlenecks and US producers’ \\ncapital discipline make a production surge unlikely. \\n\\n\\nGiven these crosscurrents, we do not hold an \\nactive tactical position in oil currently. Instead, \\nwe continue to recommend a small overweight to \\nthe US midstream sector, which offers strong cash \\nflows, benefits from growing energy volumes and \\nhas less direct exposure to oil price volatility.\\n\\n\\nGold: Golden Crossroads\\nNo other commodity shined as brightly as gold \\nlast year, with its 27% surge marking the best \\nannual performance in a decade. Gold’s strength \\nwas notable for reflecting familiar drivers—\\nsizable central bank purchases, easier monetary \\npolicy, rising national debt levels and pervasive \\ngeopolitical risks—while also defying traditional \\nheadwinds, including rising real interest rates and a \\nstronger US dollar. Last year marked only the third \\ntime since 1997 in which gold rallied despite these \\nheadwinds, although its inverse correlation with \\nUS real interest rates has weakened in recent years \\n(see Exhibit 187). \\n\\n\\nThis breakdown of once-reliable relationships \\nunderscores a notable shift in the appeal of gold \\namong key buyers. Central banks—particularly in \\ncountries such as China, India and Türkiye—have \\nsharply increased gold purchases in recent years \\nas part of broader efforts to diversify foreign \\nexchange reserves and reduce reliance on the US \\ndollar. Heightened trade uncertainty, geopolitical \\ntensions, and the US dollar’s use in sanctions \\nhave further bolstered gold’s appeal in these \\nbuyers’ eyes. \\n\\n\\nGlobal central bank purchases of gold topped \\n1,000 tonnes in 2022–23 and were on track \\nto reach similar levels again late last year (see \\nExhibit 188). Consumer demand in emerging \\nmarkets has also surged, driven by gold’s enduring \\nreputation as both a store of value and a hedge \\nagainst geopolitical risk. Collectively, this \\ndemand has supported prices even amid volatile \\nmacroeconomic conditions. \\n\\n\\nThe renewed enthusiasm for gold is also visible \\nin investor positioning. While ETF holdings of \\ngold in volume terms actually declined in 2024, \\ntheir value in dollars reached an all-time high. \\nSimilarly, net speculative positioning in the futures \\nand options markets remains elevated, standing \\nin its 88th percentile since 1995. All told, global \\ninvestment demand accounted for about a quarter \\nof gold purchases through the third quarter of last \\nyear, roughly in line with long-run averages but \\nhigher than levels seen in 2021–23.\\n\\n\\nThe macroeconomic backdrop presents a \\nmore mixed outlook for gold. We forecast positive \\nbut falling real interest rates this year, which \\nhave historically been neutral for gold relative \\nto unconditional returns (see Exhibit 189). We \\nalso expect a modestly stronger dollar, which has \\nhistorically limited meaningful gold appreciation. \\nThat said, the reliability of both of these macro \\ndrivers has weakened in recent years, as discussed. \\n\\n\\nOn balance, these crosscurrents leave us neutral \\non gold prices from current levels. Central banks \\nhave been net buyers of gold for over a decade, \\nsuggesting their demand may be structural. \\nHowever, with gold already near all-time highs \\nand investors positioned for further upside, price \\nsensitivity among buyers is likely to increase.

      "\n",
      "**Document Summary:**\n",
      "The 2023 Outlook discusses the performance and future expectations for commodities, particularly focusing on oil and gold. In 2022, commodities, led by the S&P GSCI's 23% return, outperformed other asset classes, although this was marked by significant volatility and disparities among individual commodities. Energy prices surged due to geopolitical tensions, particularly from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but have since retreated due to various bearish factors, including a release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve and declining Chinese demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "The document highlights the precarious balance between supply-side pressures and demand concerns, particularly in light of low global inventories and potential geopolitical disruptions. It anticipates oil prices to fluctuate between $70 and $100 per barrel, influenced by US production dynamics and global economic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, gold's reputation as an inflation hedge has diminished, with prices underperforming despite high inflation rates. The report maintains a neutral stance on gold, citing factors such as rising interest rates and a strong US dollar that typically suppress gold prices. However, potential demand from central banks and safe-haven buying during economic downturns could provide some support. Overall, the document emphasizes the complexity of the commodity market landscape and the need for cautious navigation amid various risks.\n",

      "**Document title: 2024 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The 2024 Outlook presents a stark contrast to the previous year's document, highlighting a significant downturn in commodity performance, with the GSCI falling 9% in 2023 compared to the previous year's strong returns. The document notes that the broad-based losses across energy, agriculture, and industrial metals were driven by high commodity prices in prior years, which led to demand conservation and increased supply capacity. This contrasts with the previous document's focus on the volatility and potential for oil prices to fluctuate between $70 and $100 per barrel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the oil sector, the 2024 Outlook emphasizes that production exceeded expectations, particularly in the US, leading to a modest 11% loss in oil prices. The anticipated demand growth for 2024 is projected to slow significantly, with expectations of 1.0–1.5 million b/d, down from 2.3 million b/d in the previous year. This is a notable shift from the previous document's more optimistic outlook on oil prices, which were expected to be influenced by geopolitical tensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold's performance also diverges from the previous document, where it was viewed as a neutral investment. In 2023, gold posted a 13% return, but the 2024 Outlook suggests a more challenging environment for gold prices due to near-record levels and mixed fundamentals. The previous document had indicated a diminishing reputation for gold as an inflation hedge, while the new document acknowledges potential support from central bank demand but remains cautious about the overall outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the 2024 Outlook reflects a more cautious and bearish sentiment towards commodities, particularly oil and gold, compared to the previous document's more optimistic and complex analysis of the commodity market landscape.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The 2025 Outlook builds on the previous year's analysis, reflecting both continuity and change in the commodity markets. While the 2024 Outlook noted a modest 4% return for the GSCI, the new document highlights a more nuanced performance across subsectors, with gains in precious metals and livestock not fully offsetting losses in agriculture and industrial metals. This contrasts with the previous document's focus on a significant downturn in commodity performance in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the oil sector, the 2025 Outlook emphasizes an \"uneasy equilibrium,\" noting that oil prices remained stable in 2024, trading within their tightest range since 2013. This stability is attributed to high spare capacity and disciplined production from OPEC+, diverging from the previous document's more volatile outlook for oil prices. Looking ahead, the document projects a similar demand growth of around 1 million b/d for 2025, with a subdued growth forecast for China, which is a shift from the previous year's more optimistic expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold's performance is a key highlight in the new document, showcasing a remarkable 27% return in 2024, driven by central bank purchases and geopolitical risks. This marks a significant departure from the previous document's neutral stance on gold, as the new outlook acknowledges the evolving dynamics of gold demand, particularly from central banks in emerging markets. However, it also expresses caution about future price sensitivity due to gold's proximity to all-time highs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the 2025 Outlook reflects a more stable and cautious sentiment towards commodities, particularly oil and gold, compared to the previous document's bearish tone. The emphasis on geopolitical risks, central bank demand, and the balance of supply and demand in oil markets indicates a complex interplay of factors shaping the commodity landscape moving forward.\n",

       "[Document(metadata={'cluster': 0, 'title': '2023 Outlook'}, page_content='Commodities were a bright spot for markets last \\nyear (see Exhibit 180). The S&P GSCI returned \\n23%, topping all other major asset classes for a \\nsecond consecutive year. But this impressive gain \\nbelied a more nuanced reality, as returns reached \\n54% by early June, only to be halved in the \\nsecond half of the year. Investors also faced a wide \\ndispersion among individual commodities and their \\nsource of returns. In contrast to the index’s overall \\nstrength, both industrial metals and precious \\nmetals suffered losses last year. And while the \\nenergy subindex outperformed with a 39% gain, \\nthe bulk of this came from positive carry, or the \\nadditional return holders of a commodity get when \\nthe futures curve is strongly downward sloping, \\ncalled “backwardation.” The appreciation in spot \\nenergy prices was a much smaller 14%.  \\n\\n\\nAgainst these risks, we note that global \\ninventories have remained low across most \\ncommodities despite months of weak Chinese \\ndemand—a sign of equally weak supply trends. A \\nthinner inventory buffer also leaves prices sensitive \\nto potential supply disruptions in politically \\nunstable areas, such as South America for base \\nmetals, or—discussed further below—Russia and \\nthe Middle East for oil. Given these crosscurrents, \\nwe believe that risks around our base case are \\nroughly balanced for industrial metals and oil \\nprices this year. As for gold, we remain doubtful \\nabout its ability to provide investors with a reliable \\nhedge against inflation or political risk given its \\nnotable failure to do so in the past year.  \\n\\n\\nGold: Not as Advertised\\nSince its meteoric rise in the 1970s, gold has been \\nhailed as an effective hedge against inflation. But \\nthat reputation was tarnished in 2022, as gold \\nprices spent most of the year trading in negative \\nterritory despite the highest inflation in four \\ndecades. This disappointing performance was \\nyet another reminder that gold is subject to a \\nmultitude of often opposing factors. Case in point: \\nthe impact of last year’s inflation surprise was \\nlargely offset by the combination of higher interest \\nrates and the surge in the US dollar, with which \\ngold tends to be negatively correlated.\\n\\n\\nThese types of crosscurrents leave us tactically \\nneutral on gold again this year. As seen in Exhibit \\n185, our expectation for softer nominal and \\nreal interest rates removes one of last year’s key \\nheadwinds to gold. Yet real rates are still likely \\nto remain in positive territory, which historically \\nhas resulted in lower-than-average gold returns \\n(see Exhibit 186). After all, positive interest rates \\ncreate an opportunity cost of holding gold, which \\ngenerates no cash flow or yield income and must \\nbe physically stored, often at a cost. \\n\\n\\nWe also do not see a compelling argument for \\ninvestors to replace their US dollar holdings with \\ngold this year, given our still constructive view on \\nthe currency. Consider that since 1971, there has \\nbeen only a 24% chance of a meaningful gold \\nrally of more than 10% in periods when the dollar \\nwas stable or rising. In fact, most meaningful \\ngold rallies have happened when the US dollar \\nwas depreciating. Put simply, when the dollar is \\nappreciating—a situation we expect this year—\\nthe low probability of strong gold returns has \\nnot historically justified the risk and volatility of \\nholding the yellow metal.   \\n\\n\\nStill, there are a few factors that could buoy \\ngold, not the least of which is a US recession that \\nmight rekindle demand for gold as a safe-haven \\nasset. Gold also stands to benefit if currently \\nunderweight investors increase their positions \\n(see Exhibit 187), which now stand 28% below \\ntheir recent peak in early 2022 and back at levels \\nlast seen in early 2020. Demand from EM central \\nbanks looking to diversify their FX reserves into \\ngold is another source of upside risk. The latest \\ndata from the World Gold Council already points \\nto record-high purchases in the most recent \\nquarter, with countries such as Turkey, China and \\nIndia leading the pack. Further geopolitical strife \\ncould even accelerate this trend.  \\n\\n\\nGiven these contradictory factors, we remain \\nneutral on gold until a clearer opportunity \\npresents itself. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'cluster': 0, 'title': '2024 Outlook'}, page_content='Last year reminded commodity investors that it’s \\nnever wise to count chickens before they hatch. \\nFollowing two years of strong performance that \\nhad reinforced investors’ belief in a new supercycle, \\nthe GSCI instead fell 9% in 2023 (see Exhibit \\n172). The losses were broad-based, with negative \\nprice performance across energy, agriculture and \\nindustrial metals.  \\n\\n\\nOutside of commonly traded commodity \\nindices, there were a couple bright spots. Uranium \\nsaw a strong rally, gaining 90% last year. We \\ncontinue to recommend a small overweight to \\nuranium, a position we initiated in March 2022 \\nbased on our view that the widening gap between \\nsupply and demand would push prices higher. With \\nsupply being slow to respond despite last year’s \\nrally, we expect uranium prices to rise further \\nthis year. \\n\\n\\nGold also stood out last year, posting a 13% \\nreturn. However, we think the backdrop for gold is \\nmore challenging in 2024, given near-record prices \\nand a more mixed fundamental outlook. \\n\\n\\nGold: Breakout Mania\\nThere is nothing quite as captivating to investors as \\na new all-time high—like that reached by gold in \\nlate December last year, when its price hit $2,077. \\nThis milestone not only fueled expectations for \\nfurther gains, but also reinforced investors’ faith \\nin several bullish catalysts for gold. These included \\nso-called de-dollarization of central banks’ \\nreserves, falling interest rates and investors’ search \\nfor safe-haven assets in times of global uncertainty. \\n\\n\\nBut as investors, we must avoid fitting a \\nnarrative to an asset’s price movements. Gold \\ndid indeed rally alongside bonds late last year, \\nbut the catalyst for the bond move was signs \\nof moderating inflation—whereas gold has the \\nreputation of being an inflation hedge. Moreover, \\nmost assets rallied during last year’s fourth quarter: \\ngold’s 11.6% return was similar to the 11.7% \\ngain of US equities but higher than the 6.8% \\nadvance of the US aggregate bond index. It is also \\nworth highlighting that this isn’t gold’s first time \\nsurpassing $2,000. In fact, it also exceeded this \\nlevel in August 2020 and March 2022, but reversed \\ncourse shortly after on both occasions. \\n\\n\\nFor the year ahead, we see several crosscurrents \\nimpacting the outlook for gold. To be sure, gold \\nhas a few supportive factors. There is scope for \\ninvestors to increase their ETF exposure to gold, \\nas current positions are more than 25 million \\nounces below their 2020 peak (see Exhibit 177). \\nEmerging market central banks are also increasing \\ntheir exposure, as they continue to diversify some \\nof their reserves into gold. Based on data up to the \\nthird quarter of last year, these central banks added \\naround 1,000 tonnes of gold to their balance sheets \\nlast year, accounting for nearly 30% of global gold \\nproduction. However, this is not an incremental \\nsource of demand, as they purchased about the \\nsame amount the previous year (see Exhibit 178). \\n\\n\\nAs was the case last year, our expectation \\nfor lower nominal interest rates could also \\nbenefit gold. Recall that lower rates reduce the \\nopportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t \\nyield any income and needs to be stored, often \\nat a cost. This interest rate dynamic can also be \\nindirectly observed through gold’s positive reaction \\nto past Federal Reserve rate cuts. In fact, in the six \\nmonths following the first rate cut of a cycle, gold \\nprices have rallied 60% of the time, by a median of \\n6.2% (see Exhibit 179). \\n\\n\\nHowever, the fact that disinflation is pushing \\ninterest rates lower could weaken this dynamic. That \\nhas been the case historically, as real interest rates \\nhave been a more important driver of gold prices \\nthan nominal interest rates. Falling but positive real \\nrates, which we expect this year, have historically \\nbeen roughly neutral for gold prices compared to \\ntheir unconditional performance. Capitalizing on \\nthese rate movements also requires precise timing, as \\nthe median gold return in the six months before the \\nfirst Federal Reserve rate cut has been a 1.9% loss, \\nwith only a 50% chance of a gain. \\n\\n\\nWe do not expect the US dollar \\nto provide a clear catalyst to gold \\nprices either. While there is a negative \\ncorrelation between gold and the \\ndollar, it has historically taken a large \\ndollar depreciation to push gold prices \\nmeaningfully higher, which is not our \\ncentral case. In fact, we expect the dollar \\nto appreciate this year. \\nThere is nothing quite as captivating \\nto investors as a new all-time high—\\nlike that reached by gold in late \\nDecember last year.\\n\\n\\nIn short, we do not believe these conflicting \\nfactors convincingly justify today’s already high \\ngold prices, leaving us neutral until a clearer \\nopportunity presents itself.

       " Document(metadata={'cluster': 0, 'title': '2025 Outlook'}, page_content='Commodity markets often change the locks just \\nwhen investors think they have found the keys. \\nRecent years have been no exception: investors \\ngained confidence after two consecutive years of \\nexcess returns in 2021 and 2022—fueled by supply \\nchain disruptions, rising inflation and Russia’s \\ninvasion of Ukraine—only to be caught off guard \\nby losses in 2023 and just a modest rebound last \\nyear. The GSCI’s 4% return in 2024 also masked \\nuneven performance across subsectors. Gains in \\nprecious metals and livestock weren’t enough to \\noffset losses in agriculture and industrial metals.\\n\\n\\nGold emerged as a standout performer last \\nyear, reaching a new all-time high in October and \\noutperforming the S&P 500 with a 27% spot \\nreturn. Its strength was driven by a combination of \\nfactors, including elevated central bank purchases, \\nmonetary easing, rising national debt concerns and \\ngeopolitical risks.\\n\\n\\nWhile we remain neutral on commodities \\noverall, we continue to recommend a small \\noverweight to uranium, which we believe offers \\nattractive asymmetry given an ongoing structural \\ndeficit (see Section I, Our Tactical Tilts).\\n\\n\\nGold: Golden Crossroads\\nNo other commodity shined as brightly as gold \\nlast year, with its 27% surge marking the best \\nannual performance in a decade. Gold’s strength \\nwas notable for reflecting familiar drivers—\\nsizable central bank purchases, easier monetary \\npolicy, rising national debt levels and pervasive \\ngeopolitical risks—while also defying traditional \\nheadwinds, including rising real interest rates and a \\nstronger US dollar. Last year marked only the third \\ntime since 1997 in which gold rallied despite these \\nheadwinds, although its inverse correlation with \\nUS real interest rates has weakened in recent years \\n(see Exhibit 187). \\n\\n\\nThis breakdown of once-reliable relationships \\nunderscores a notable shift in the appeal of gold \\namong key buyers. Central banks—particularly in \\ncountries such as China, India and Türkiye—have \\nsharply increased gold purchases in recent years \\nas part of broader efforts to diversify foreign \\nexchange reserves and reduce reliance on the US \\ndollar. Heightened trade uncertainty, geopolitical \\ntensions, and the US dollar’s use in sanctions \\nhave further bolstered gold’s appeal in these \\nbuyers’ eyes. \\n\\n\\nGlobal central bank purchases of gold topped \\n1,000 tonnes in 2022–23 and were on track \\nto reach similar levels again late last year (see \\nExhibit 188). Consumer demand in emerging \\nmarkets has also surged, driven by gold’s enduring \\nreputation as both a store of value and a hedge \\nagainst geopolitical risk. Collectively, this \\ndemand has supported prices even amid volatile \\nmacroeconomic conditions. \\n\\n\\nThe renewed enthusiasm for gold is also visible \\nin investor positioning. While ETF holdings of \\ngold in volume terms actually declined in 2024, \\ntheir value in dollars reached an all-time high. \\nSimilarly, net speculative positioning in the futures \\nand options markets remains elevated, standing \\nin its 88th percentile since 1995. All told, global \\ninvestment demand accounted for about a quarter \\nof gold purchases through the third quarter of last \\nyear, roughly in line with long-run averages but \\nhigher than levels seen in 2021–23.\\n\\n\\nThe macroeconomic backdrop presents a \\nmore mixed outlook for gold. We forecast positive \\nbut falling real interest rates this year, which \\nhave historically been neutral for gold relative \\nto unconditional returns (see Exhibit 189). We \\nalso expect a modestly stronger dollar, which has \\nhistorically limited meaningful gold appreciation. \\nThat said, the reliability of both of these macro \\ndrivers has weakened in recent years, as discussed. \\n\\n\\nOn balance, these crosscurrents leave us neutral \\non gold prices from current levels. Central banks \\nhave been net buyers of gold for over a decade, \\nsuggesting their demand may be structural. \\nHowever, with gold already near all-time highs \\nand investors positioned for further upside, price \\nsensitivity among buyers is likely to increase.

       " Document(metadata={'cluster': 1, 'title': '2023 Outlook'}, page_content='\\n\\n\\nThe disjointed nature of these returns reflects \\nthe tug-of-war between bullish supply-side \\npressures and bearish demand-side concerns that is \\nlikely to continue in the year ahead. Although years \\nof underinvestment are an underlying support for \\nmany commodity prices, a deeper global economic \\nslowdown could quickly undermine demand, \\nespecially given the still-uncertain trajectory of \\nChina’s economy amid its shifting COVID policies. \\n\\n\\nOil: High Risks, Low Inventories\\nOil prices last year were driven by geopolitical \\ndevelopments to a degree not seen since the \\nturbulent 1970s. As seen in Exhibit 181, close \\nto 10% of global oil production found itself at \\nrisk of disruption virtually overnight in the wake \\nof Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing \\nrollout of Western sanctions. Given already low \\nglobal oil inventories and thin spare capacity, oil \\nprices understandably spiked higher, reaching $124 \\nat their peak closing level last March. \\n\\n\\nPrices have since fallen back below pre-war \\nlevels. This surprising retracement reflects not only \\nthe failure of supply risks to materialize, but also \\na combination of bearish developments, including \\nan unprecedented 200-million-barrel release from \\nthe US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a COVID-\\ndriven slump in Chinese oil demand and fears of \\nan impending recession. \\n\\n\\nAlthough oil prices have receded, the bullish \\nrisks that underpinned their initial spike higher \\nhave not disappeared. The full effect of European \\nsanctions on Russia will not be visible in energy \\nmarkets until the first quarter of this year. These \\ncurbs directly impact 0.5 million b/d of seaborne \\ncrude oil and 1.1 million b/d of refined products. \\nWhile Russia has so far been successful at \\nredirecting crude exports to India and China, this \\nstrategy is starting to show some limits (see Exhibit \\n182). Moreover, it will be difficult for Russia to \\nreplicate this strategy in refined products, as both \\nChina and India were net exporters in this category \\nlast year.\\n\\n\\nAs a result, close to 2 million b/d of Russian \\nsupplies to Europe remain at risk. Consensus \\ncurrently expects a net loss of less than half that \\namount, increasing the risk of an upside surprise. \\nUpward pressure on energy prices could also \\narise from supply disruptions in other countries, \\ngiven geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and \\ndomestic instability in Libya and other exporting \\ncountries.  \\n\\n\\nTo be sure, the demand for oil faces an equally \\nhigh degree of risk amid a potential US recession and \\nthe still-uncertain trajectory of China’s economy. We \\nestimate that Chinese demand fell by 0.5 million b/d \\non average last year, marking the first annual decline \\nsince 1990 (see Exhibit 183). While a successful \\nreopening of China’s economy could help offset \\nweaker oil demand elsewhere, a more protracted \\nCOVID wave could exacerbate demand concerns. \\nFor now, we expect global demand to remain on an \\nupward trajectory in our base case, exceeding pre-\\nCOVID levels by year-end.  \\n\\n\\nMeeting this demand will require continuing \\ngrowth from US producers, as OPEC has already \\nramped its output back to pre-COVID levels \\nand has limited spare capacity. But to incentivize \\nadditional drilling, oil prices must remain high \\nenough to overcome the cost inflation and self-\\nimposed capital discipline now holding back \\nUS production. In contrast, lower prices and \\ndisappointing demand would likely restrain \\nproduction growth. Tellingly, the November and \\nDecember oil price slump was rapidly followed by \\na decline in US drilling and completion activity, \\nwhile OPEC immediately announced a production \\ncut to rescue prices. \\n\\n\\nGiven these moving pieces, we expect WTI \\nprices to trade in a $70–100 range by year-end, \\nwhich would imply upside from current levels. \\nBut we are mindful of the many risks that could \\nundermine this forecast—including a US recession, \\nanother wave of global COVID infections or a \\nquick resolution to the conflict in Ukraine—any \\none of which could push prices down to cost \\nsupport near $60. That said, we would not expect \\nthese lower prices to be sustained for an extended \\nperiod, given producers’ likely reaction. There are \\nalso upside risks. Any additional supply disruptions \\nwould be magnified by still-low inventories, which could push prices above our \\nforecast range, as happened last year. \\n\\n\\nAlthough we do not have an active tactical \\nallocation to oil, we do continue to recommend \\na small overweight to the US midstream sector, \\nwhich benefits from strong cash flows and less \\ndirect exposure to oil price volatility.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'cluster': 1, 'title': '2024 Outlook'}, page_content='\\n\\n\\nThe high prices of commodities coming into \\nlast year proved to be the antidote for even higher \\nprices, as they incentivized a mix of demand \\nconservation, investment in supply capacity and \\nproductivity improvements. This dynamic was \\nparticularly visible in the oil patch last year, where \\nproduction exceeded expectations in several \\ncountries despite producers’ capital discipline. The \\nresulting spare capacity is likely to limit upside \\nagain this year, barring major supply disruptions.   \\n\\n\\nOil: Threading the Needle\\n“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into \\ntrouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t \\nso.” That quote, often attributed to Mark Twain, \\nproved apt for oil investors last year, as some \\nwidely expected developments failed to materialize. \\nThe almost universal expectation that oil prices \\nwould surge due to Russian sanctions limiting \\nsupply did not occur. Instead, Russia successfully \\nredirected most of these sanctioned exports to \\nChina and India. Predictions of a slowdown in US \\nproduction growth also missed the mark, as US \\nproducers recorded their fastest growth rate since \\n2019. With these bullish catalysts not happening \\nthe way people thought they would, oil prices \\nended the year with a modest 11% loss.\\n\\n\\nOil begins the year trading at the lower end of \\nits annual range. However, this does not negate the \\npotential downside risks for 2024, as we anticipate \\nchallenges stemming from both demand and \\nsupply dynamics. Sustaining the recent demand \\ngrowth rate will be challenging now that the post-\\npandemic recovery has largely run its course. We \\npredict that demand growth will return to a trend-\\nlike pace of 1.0–1.5 million b/d this year in the \\nabsence of a recession, a significant deceleration \\nfrom last year’s 2.3 million b/d increase (see \\nExhibit 173).\\n\\n\\nThis slower demand growth will likely require \\nrestraint on the part of producers to keep the \\nmarket in balance. For their part, US producers \\nhave consistently demonstrated discipline in their \\nallocation of capital. Over the last 12 months, these \\nproducers have returned 49% of their cash flows \\nto investors compared to 37% per year between \\n2014 and 2019. However, productivity has also \\nimproved in recent years, such that the same dollar \\nof capital spending now generates more oil. As a \\nresult, US production is likely to continue growing \\ndespite ongoing capital discipline. \\n\\n\\nThe potential for output restraint among other \\nnon-OPEC producers is just as dubious. Brazil, \\nGuyana and Canada have all experienced a notable \\nuptick in their oil output recently. What’s \\nmore, their production is unlikely to be \\naffected by oil prices, as it stems from \\nyears of investment in offshore and oil \\nsands projects that are just now coming \\nonline. Ultimately, oil production from \\nthese projects could crowd out further \\nexpansion from US shale. \\nThe high prices of commodities \\ncoming into last year proved to be the \\nantidote for even higher prices.\\n\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, the burden of managing \\nsupply relative to demand rests with OPEC, where \\nthere is arguably little room for further reductions. \\nOPEC production already stands at 10-year lows \\nand has been higher than current levels 88% of \\nthe time in the past 20 years73 (see Exhibit 174). \\nSimilarly, the production of Saudi Arabia—often \\nconsidered the ultimate swing producer—has \\nseldom fallen below its current level. Going \\nforward, OPEC’s determination to support prices \\ncould be tested if further production cuts become \\nnecessary. Indeed, at OPEC’s November 2023 \\nmeeting, the decision to further reduce production \\nsparked internal disagreements, leading to Angola’s \\nexit from the organization in protest.\\n\\n\\nConsidering these challenges, we expect WTI \\nprices to trade in a $60–80 range by year-end, \\nimplying minimal upside from current levels. That \\nsaid, we are mindful of several risks that could \\npotentially undermine our forecast. The likelihood \\nof supply disruptions is growing given prevalent \\ngeopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East, as well \\nas instability in countries like Libya and Nigeria. \\nAt the same time, global oil production outages \\nexcluding Russia currently stand near their lowest \\nlevel in 10 years (see Exhibit 175).  While any price \\nspike would likely be temporary given OPEC’s \\nhistorically high spare capacity (see Exhibit 176), \\na spike could still cause significant disruptions in \\nthe short term. There are also legitimate downside \\nrisks to oil prices, including a US recession, an \\nabrupt reversal of OPEC cuts or even a lack of \\nproduction discipline among OPEC members. \\n\\n\\nIn light of these various crosscurrents, we \\ndo not have an active tactical allocation to oil. \\nHowever, we continue to recommend a small \\noverweight position to the US midstream sector, \\nwhich benefits from strong cash flows, growing \\nvolumes and less direct exposure to oil price \\nvolatility.

This \\nresilience reflected historically high spare capacity \\nin oil markets, which helped balance declining \\ninventories and modest periodic disruptions. \\nLooking ahead, we expect steady global economic \\ngrowth to support demand, while ample spare \\ncapacity should again keep prices in check, barring \\na major supply disruption.\\n\\n\\nOil: Uneasy Equilibrium\\nOil did not live up to its reputation for volatility \\nin 2024. Prices traded within their tightest range \\nsince 2013 in percentage terms and within their \\nnarrowest range since 1998 in real dollar terms. \\nWTI crude oil spent nearly 80% of 2024 within \\nour expected trading range of $60–80 and ended \\nthe year flat. This uncharacteristic stability reflected \\na balanced oil market, where ample spare capacity, \\ndisciplined production and moderating demand \\ngrowth combined to offset geopolitical risks.  \\n\\n\\nSupply disruptions remained modest despite \\nactive military conflicts in the Middle East \\nand Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. OPEC+ \\nmaintained remarkable discipline, extending \\nproduction cut agreements through 2026 and \\npostponing plans to unwind cuts. This resulted \\nin historically high spare capacity, providing a \\nbuffer against unexpected supply shocks (see \\nExhibit 183). Meanwhile, global oil demand \\ngrowth slowed for a third straight year, even as \\nconsumption demand recovered from pandemic \\ndistortions and reached a new all-time high.\\n\\n\\nLooking ahead to 2025, we expect trend-like \\nglobal economic activity to drive oil demand \\nhigher by around 1 million b/d, similar to last \\nyear. However, Chinese demand growth is likely to \\nremain subdued at around 0.1–0.2 million b/d due \\nto its slower economic growth (see Section II) and \\na shift away from petroleum-consuming passenger \\nand freight transportation vehicles. This would \\nleave China’s demand growth trailing India’s for a \\nsecond year (see Exhibit 184).\\n\\n\\nTo keep the market in balance, oil supply will \\nneed to increase to meet demand growth. Increased \\noil production is most likely to come from among \\nnon-OPEC+ countries, which now contribute the \\nmajority of global oil supply (see Exhibit 185). \\nIndeed, the approximately 1.2 million b/d in supply \\ngrowth we expect from countries such as the US, \\nGuyana, Brazil and Canada is sufficient to satisfy \\nglobal demand growth on its own. Moreover, much \\nof this expected growth arises from large-scale \\noffshore developments whose production is not \\nsensitive to market oil prices. \\n\\n\\nGiven this non-OPEC+ growth, the burden of \\nmanaging supply relative to demand rests with \\nOPEC+. We expect the group to maintain its recent \\nsupply discipline this year unless prices move \\nsustainably higher. This should ensure ample spare \\ncapacity to absorb unexpected disruptions. \\n\\n\\nGiven a roughly balanced oil market, we \\nexpect WTI crude oil prices to end 2025 in a range \\nof $60–80, consistent with the current forward \\ncurve and last year’s range. That said, risks to our \\noutlook remain. OPEC’s spare capacity provides a \\ntangible buffer, but the oil market’s other buffer—\\nobservable global oil inventories—is near multiyear \\nlows (see Exhibit 186). Additionally, OPEC+ could \\nchoose not to respond swiftly to a supply shock, \\nwhile weaker global demand, a lapse in OPEC+ \\nproduction discipline and larger-than-expected \\nnon-OPEC+ production growth could also test \\nmarket stability. \\n\\n\\nPolicy uncertainty also looms. The incoming \\nTrump administration may tighten sanctions on \\nIran, Russia and Venezuela, but is likely to prioritize \\nlow energy prices—balancing geopolitical objectives \\nwith domestic economic considerations. Meanwhile, \\nwhile deregulation could increase oil drilling \\npermits, logistical bottlenecks and US producers’ \\ncapital discipline make a production surge unlikely. \\n\\n\\nGiven these crosscurrents, we do not hold an \\nactive tactical position in oil currently.

      "The 2023 Outlook highlights the performance of commodities in the previous year, noting that the S&P GSCI achieved a 23% return, outperforming other asset classes for the second year in a row. However, this overall gain masked significant volatility, with returns peaking at 54% by June before halving in the latter half of the year. Individual commodities showed varied performance, with industrial and precious metals experiencing losses, while the energy subindex gained 39%, primarily due to positive carry rather than spot price appreciation.\n",

      "Despite low global inventories and weak Chinese demand, the document suggests that supply disruptions could impact prices, particularly for industrial metals and oil. The outlook for gold is cautious, as it failed to act as a reliable hedge against inflation in 2022, with its performance negatively affected by rising interest rates and a strong US dollar. The authors maintain a neutral stance on gold for 2023, citing the low probability of significant rallies when the dollar is stable or appreciating. However, potential factors that could support gold prices include a US recession, increased demand from underweight investors, and central bank purchases, particularly from emerging markets.

      "The 2024 Outlook presents a stark contrast to the previous year's performance, as the GSCI fell by 9% in 2023, marking a significant downturn after two years of strong returns. This decline was broad-based, affecting energy, agriculture, and industrial metals. However, uranium emerged as a notable exception, experiencing a remarkable 90% rally, prompting a recommendation for a small overweight position in uranium due to persistent supply-demand imbalances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold also performed well in 2023, achieving a 13% return and reaching an all-time high of $2,077 in December. Despite this, the outlook for gold in 2024 is more cautious, with challenges stemming from near-record prices and a mixed fundamental environment. While supportive factors for gold include potential increases in ETF exposure and central bank purchases, the document warns that disinflation and a likely appreciating US dollar may hinder gold's performance. The authors maintain a neutral stance on gold, similar to the previous document, until clearer opportunities arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while both documents express a neutral outlook on gold, the 2024 Outlook highlights a broader decline in commodity performance compared to the previous year's gains, with uranium standing out as a bright spot. The cautious tone regarding gold reflects a shift from the previous document's more optimistic view, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of market dynamics.\n",

      "The 2025 Outlook reflects a cautious yet nuanced perspective on commodity markets, building on the previous year's modest recovery. The GSCI's 4% return in 2024 indicates a mixed performance across subsectors, with gains in precious metals and livestock failing to offset losses in agriculture and industrial metals. Gold stands out as a significant performer, achieving a remarkable 27% return and reaching a new all-time high in October, driven by central bank purchases, monetary easing, and geopolitical risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to the 2024 Outlook, the 2025 document maintains a neutral stance on commodities overall while continuing to recommend a small overweight in uranium due to ongoing structural deficits. However, the 2025 Outlook emphasizes a notable shift in gold's appeal, highlighting increased central bank purchases and consumer demand in emerging markets, which have supported prices despite macroeconomic volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "While both documents express caution regarding gold, the 2025 Outlook presents a more optimistic view of gold's performance compared to the previous year's neutral stance. The 2025 document acknowledges the complexities of the macroeconomic environment, forecasting positive but declining real interest rates and a modestly stronger dollar, which could limit gold's appreciation.

      "**Document Summary:**\n",
      "The 2023 Outlook highlights the performance of commodities in the previous year, noting that the S&P GSCI achieved a 23% return, outperforming other asset classes for the second consecutive year. However, this overall strength masked significant volatility, with returns peaking at 54% by June before halving in the latter half of the year. Individual commodities showed varied performance; while the energy subindex gained 39%, industrial and precious metals faced losses. Low global inventories, despite weak Chinese demand, indicate potential price sensitivity to supply disruptions, particularly in politically unstable regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document expresses skepticism about gold's effectiveness as a hedge against inflation and political risk, citing its poor performance in 2022 despite high inflation. Factors such as rising interest rates and a strong US dollar negatively impacted gold prices. The outlook for gold remains neutral, with expectations of softer interest rates potentially alleviating some headwinds, but positive real rates historically correlate with lower gold returns. The document notes that gold rallies are less likely when the dollar is stable or rising, a scenario anticipated for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these challenges, potential factors that could support gold prices include a US recession, increased demand from underweight investors, and central banks diversifying their reserves into gold. However, the overall stance on gold remains neutral until clearer opportunities arise.\n",

      "\n",
      "Gold also performed well, achieving a 13% return, but the outlook for 2024 is more challenging due to near-record prices and a mixed fundamental environment. The document highlights gold's recent all-time high of $2,077 in December, which fueled bullish expectations linked to central bank de-dollarization, falling interest rates, and safe-haven demand amid global uncertainty. However, it cautions against overinterpreting price movements, noting that gold's rally coincided with broader market gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several factors are expected to influence gold's performance this year. While there is potential for increased ETF exposure and continued central bank purchases, these are not expected to significantly boost demand.

Additionally, the US dollar's expected appreciation may not provide a favorable backdrop for gold.\n",

The GSCI recorded a modest 4% return in 2024, contrasting with the previous document's 9% decline in 2023. While precious metals, particularly gold, and livestock showed gains, losses in agriculture and industrial metals created an uneven performance landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold emerged as a standout performer, achieving a remarkable 27% return in 2024, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. This surge was driven by factors such as increased central bank purchases, monetary easing, and geopolitical risks, marking a shift from the previous document's more cautious outlook on gold. The 2024 performance was notable for occurring despite rising real interest rates and a stronger US dollar, which traditionally hinder gold prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document maintains a neutral stance on commodities overall, similar to the previous document, but continues to recommend a small overweight in uranium due to ongoing structural deficits. The renewed enthusiasm for gold is underscored by significant central bank purchases and rising consumer demand in emerging markets, contrasting with the previous document's more tempered expectations for gold's demand.\n",

      "**Document Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2023 Outlook discusses the conflicting dynamics in commodity markets, particularly oil, driven by supply-side pressures and demand-side concerns. Key points include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Market Dynamics**: The tug-of-war between bullish supply factors and bearish demand concerns is expected to persist, influenced by global economic conditions and uncertainties in China's economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Oil Price Trends**: Oil prices surged to $124 due to geopolitical tensions, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but have since fallen below pre-war levels due to reduced supply risks and a significant release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Supply Risks**: The full impact of European sanctions on Russian oil exports is yet to be seen, with potential losses of up to 2 million barrels per day (b/d) still at risk. However, consensus estimates suggest a smaller net loss, which could lead to upward price surprises.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Demand Concerns**: Oil demand is under threat from a potential US recession and a decline in Chinese demand, which fell by 0.5 million b/d last year. A successful reopening of China's economy could help, but ongoing COVID challenges remain a concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Production Outlook**: Meeting anticipated demand will require growth from US producers, as OPEC has limited spare capacity. High oil prices are necessary to incentivize increased US drilling, while lower prices could hinder production growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Price Forecast**: WTI prices are expected to range between $70 and $100 by year-end, with various risks that could push prices down to $60 or potentially higher due to supply disruptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Investment Strategy**: While there is no active tactical allocation to oil, a small overweight in the US midstream sector is recommended due to its strong cash flows and reduced exposure to oil price volatility.\n",
      "**Document title: 2024 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2024 Outlook builds on the previous year's analysis by highlighting the evolving dynamics in the oil market, reflecting both continuity and change from the 2023 Outlook. Key points include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Market Dynamics**: Similar to 2023, the document emphasizes the balance between supply and demand, but notes that high commodity prices from the previous year have led to increased production and investment, which may limit price increases in 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Oil Price Trends**: While the 2023 Outlook noted a surge in oil prices due to geopolitical tensions, the 2024 Outlook reveals a modest 11% loss in oil prices by year-end, with current trading at the lower end of the annual range. The forecast for WTI prices is now set between $60 and $80, indicating a more cautious outlook compared to the previous year's range of $70 to $100.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Supply Risks**: The 2024 document highlights that US production growth exceeded expectations, contrasting with the previous year's concerns about potential slowdowns. However, it also notes that OPEC's production is at a 10-year low, suggesting limited capacity for further reductions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Demand Concerns**: The anticipated demand growth for 2024 is projected to decelerate to 1.0–1.5 million b/d, down from 2.3 million b/d in 2023, reflecting a shift in expectations regarding post-pandemic recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Production Outlook**: The 2024 Outlook indicates that US producers are maintaining capital discipline while also improving productivity, which may lead to continued production growth. This contrasts with the previous document's emphasis on the need for US producers to incentivize drilling through high prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Price Forecast**: The price forecast for WTI has shifted downward, reflecting a more cautious stance on potential price spikes and the impact of geopolitical uncertainties, compared to the previous year's more optimistic range.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Investment Strategy**: Consistent with the previous document, there is no active tactical allocation to oil, but a recommendation for a small overweight in the US midstream sector remains, emphasizing its strong cash flows and reduced exposure to oil price volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the 2024 Outlook presents a more tempered view of the oil market, acknowledging the complexities of supply and demand while adjusting price expectations downward compared to the 2023 Outlook.\n",
      "**Document title: 2025 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2025 Outlook continues the analysis from the 2024 Outlook, reflecting both continuity and evolution in the oil market dynamics. Key points include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Market Stability**: Unlike the previous year, where oil prices experienced modest fluctuations, the 2024 market showed unprecedented stability, with WTI prices remaining flat and trading within a narrow range of $60–80. This contrasts with the 2023 Outlook's more volatile price expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Supply and Demand Balance**: The 2025 Outlook emphasizes a balanced oil market, supported by historically high spare capacity and disciplined production from OPEC+. This is a continuation from 2024, where similar factors were noted, but with a more pronounced focus on the resilience against geopolitical risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Demand Growth**: Projected demand growth for 2025 is expected to be around 1 million b/d, mirroring the previous year's expectations. However, Chinese demand growth is anticipated to slow significantly, diverging from the robust recovery seen in other regions, which contrasts with the more optimistic demand forecasts from 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Production Outlook**: The document highlights that non-OPEC+ countries are expected to drive supply growth, with an anticipated increase of 1.2 million b/d from countries like the US and Brazil. This marks a shift from the previous year's emphasis on US production growth alone, indicating a broader global contribution to supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Price Forecast**: The price forecast remains consistent with the previous year, maintaining the $60–80 range for WTI crude oil. This reflects a cautious but stable outlook, contrasting with the more volatile price expectations noted in earlier documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Investment Strategy**: Similar to the previous documents, there is no active tactical allocation to oil, but a recommendation for a small overweight in the US midstream sector persists, highlighting its strong cash flows and reduced exposure to oil price volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the 2025 Outlook presents a stable and balanced view of the oil market, with a focus on the resilience of supply and demand dynamics, while acknowledging potential risks and uncertainties that could impact market stability, differing from the more cautious tone of the 2024 Outlook.\n",
