       "[Document(id='2023 Outlook', metadata={}, page_content='Commodities were a bright spot for markets last \\nyear (see Exhibit 180). The S&P GSCI returned \\n23%, topping all other major asset classes for a \\nsecond consecutive year. But this impressive gain \\nbelied a more nuanced reality, as returns reached \\n54% by early June, only to be halved in the \\nsecond half of the year. Investors also faced a wide \\ndispersion among individual commodities and their \\nsource of returns. In contrast to the index’s overall \\nstrength, both industrial metals and precious \\nmetals suffered losses last year. And while the \\nenergy subindex outperformed with a 39% gain, \\nthe bulk of this came from positive carry, or the \\nadditional return holders of a commodity get when \\nthe futures curve is strongly downward sloping, \\ncalled “backwardation.” The appreciation in spot \\nenergy prices was a much smaller 14%.  \\n\\n\\nThe disjointed nature of these returns reflects \\nthe tug-of-war between bullish supply-side \\npressures and bearish demand-side concerns that is \\nlikely to continue in the year ahead. Although years \\nof underinvestment are an underlying support for \\nmany commodity prices, a deeper global economic \\nslowdown could quickly undermine demand, \\nespecially given the still-uncertain trajectory of \\nChina’s economy amid its shifting COVID policies. \\n\\n\\nAgainst these risks, we note that global \\ninventories have remained low across most \\ncommodities despite months of weak Chinese \\ndemand—a sign of equally weak supply trends. A \\nthinner inventory buffer also leaves prices sensitive \\nto potential supply disruptions in politically \\nunstable areas, such as South America for base \\nmetals, or—discussed further below—Russia and \\nthe Middle East for oil. Given these crosscurrents, \\nwe believe that risks around our base case are \\nroughly balanced for industrial metals and oil \\nprices this year. As for gold, we remain doubtful \\nabout its ability to provide investors with a reliable \\nhedge against inflation or political risk given its \\nnotable failure to do so in the past year.  \\n\\n\\nOil: High Risks, Low Inventories\\nOil prices last year were driven by geopolitical \\ndevelopments to a degree not seen since the \\nturbulent 1970s. As seen in Exhibit 181, close \\nto 10% of global oil production found itself at \\nrisk of disruption virtually overnight in the wake \\nof Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing \\nrollout of Western sanctions. Given already low \\nglobal oil inventories and thin spare capacity, oil \\nprices understandably spiked higher, reaching $124 \\nat their peak closing level last March. \\n\\n\\nPrices have since fallen back below pre-war \\nlevels. This surprising retracement reflects not only \\nthe failure of supply risks to materialize, but also \\na combination of bearish developments, including \\nan unprecedented 200-million-barrel release from \\nthe US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a COVID-\\ndriven slump in Chinese oil demand and fears of \\nan impending recession. \\n\\n\\nAlthough oil prices have receded, the bullish \\nrisks that underpinned their initial spike higher \\nhave not disappeared. The full effect of European \\nsanctions on Russia will not be visible in energy \\nmarkets until the first quarter of this year. These \\ncurbs directly impact 0.5 million b/d of seaborne \\ncrude oil and 1.1 million b/d of refined products. \\nWhile Russia has so far been successful at \\nredirecting crude exports to India and China, this \\nstrategy is starting to show some limits (see Exhibit \\n182). Moreover, it will be difficult for Russia to \\nreplicate this strategy in refined products, as both \\nChina and India were net exporters in this category \\nlast year.\\n\\n\\nAs a result, close to 2 million b/d of Russian \\nsupplies to Europe remain at risk. Consensus \\ncurrently expects a net loss of less than half that \\namount, increasing the risk of an upside surprise. \\nUpward pressure on energy prices could also \\narise from supply disruptions in other countries, \\ngiven geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and \\ndomestic instability in Libya and other exporting \\ncountries.  \\n\\n\\nTo be sure, the demand for oil faces an equally \\nhigh degree of risk amid a potential US recession and \\nthe still-uncertain trajectory of China’s economy. We \\nestimate that Chinese demand fell by 0.5 million b/d \\non average last year, marking the first annual decline \\nsince 1990 (see Exhibit 183). While a successful \\nreopening of China’s economy could help offset \\nweaker oil demand elsewhere, a more protracted \\nCOVID wave could exacerbate demand concerns. \\nFor now, we expect global demand to remain on an \\nupward trajectory in our base case, exceeding pre-\\nCOVID levels by year-end.  \\n\\n\\nMeeting this demand will require continuing \\ngrowth from US producers, as OPEC has already \\nramped its output back to pre-COVID levels \\nand has limited spare capacity. But to incentivize \\nadditional drilling, oil prices must remain high \\nenough to overcome the cost inflation and self-\\nimposed capital discipline now holding back \\nUS production. In contrast, lower prices and \\ndisappointing demand would likely restrain \\nproduction growth. Tellingly, the November and \\nDecember oil price slump was rapidly followed by \\na decline in US drilling and completion activity, \\nwhile OPEC immediately announced a production \\ncut to rescue prices. \\n\\n\\nGiven these moving pieces, we expect WTI \\nprices to trade in a $70–100 range by year-end, \\nwhich would imply upside from current levels. \\nBut we are mindful of the many risks that could \\nundermine this forecast—including a US recession, \\nanother wave of global COVID infections or a \\nquick resolution to the conflict in Ukraine—any \\none of which could push prices down to cost \\nsupport near $60. That said, we would not expect \\nthese lower prices to be sustained for an extended \\nperiod, given producers’ likely reaction. There are \\nalso upside risks. Any additional supply disruptions \\nwould be magnified by still-low inventories, which could push prices above our \\nforecast range, as happened last year. \\n\\n\\nAlthough we do not have an active tactical \\nallocation to oil, we do continue to recommend \\na small overweight to the US midstream sector, \\nwhich benefits from strong cash flows and less \\ndirect exposure to oil price volatility.\\n\\n\\nGold: Not as Advertised\\nSince its meteoric rise in the 1970s, gold has been \\nhailed as an effective hedge against inflation. But \\nthat reputation was tarnished in 2022, as gold \\nprices spent most of the year trading in negative \\nterritory despite the highest inflation in four \\ndecades. This disappointing performance was \\nyet another reminder that gold is subject to a \\nmultitude of often opposing factors. Case in point: \\nthe impact of last year’s inflation surprise was \\nlargely offset by the combination of higher interest \\nrates and the surge in the US dollar, with which \\ngold tends to be negatively correlated.\\n\\n\\nThese types of crosscurrents leave us tactically \\nneutral on gold again this year. As seen in Exhibit \\n185, our expectation for softer nominal and \\nreal interest rates removes one of last year’s key \\nheadwinds to gold. Yet real rates are still likely \\nto remain in positive territory, which historically \\nhas resulted in lower-than-average gold returns \\n(see Exhibit 186). After all, positive interest rates \\ncreate an opportunity cost of holding gold, which \\ngenerates no cash flow or yield income and must \\nbe physically stored, often at a cost. \\n\\n\\nWe also do not see a compelling argument for \\ninvestors to replace their US dollar holdings with \\ngold this year, given our still constructive view on \\nthe currency. Consider that since 1971, there has \\nbeen only a 24% chance of a meaningful gold \\nrally of more than 10% in periods when the dollar \\nwas stable or rising. In fact, most meaningful \\ngold rallies have happened when the US dollar \\nwas depreciating. Put simply, when the dollar is \\nappreciating—a situation we expect this year—\\nthe low probability of strong gold returns has \\nnot historically justified the risk and volatility of \\nholding the yellow metal.   \\n\\n\\nStill, there are a few factors that could buoy \\ngold, not the least of which is a US recession that \\nmight rekindle demand for gold as a safe-haven \\nasset. Gold also stands to benefit if currently \\nunderweight investors increase their positions \\n(see Exhibit 187), which now stand 28% below \\ntheir recent peak in early 2022 and back at levels \\nlast seen in early 2020. Demand from EM central \\nbanks looking to diversify their FX reserves into \\ngold is another source of upside risk. The latest \\ndata from the World Gold Council already points \\nto record-high purchases in the most recent \\nquarter, with countries such as Turkey, China and \\nIndia leading the pack. Further geopolitical strife \\ncould even accelerate this trend.  \\n\\n\\nGiven these contradictory factors, we remain \\nneutral on gold until a clearer opportunity \\npresents itself. '),\n",
       " Document(id='2024 Outlook', metadata={}, page_content='Last year reminded commodity investors that it’s \\nnever wise to count chickens before they hatch. \\nFollowing two years of strong performance that \\nhad reinforced investors’ belief in a new supercycle, \\nthe GSCI instead fell 9% in 2023 (see Exhibit \\n172). The losses were broad-based, with negative \\nprice performance across energy, agriculture and \\nindustrial metals.  \\n\\n\\nThe high prices of commodities coming into \\nlast year proved to be the antidote for even higher \\nprices, as they incentivized a mix of demand \\nconservation, investment in supply capacity and \\nproductivity improvements. This dynamic was \\nparticularly visible in the oil patch last year, where \\nproduction exceeded expectations in several \\ncountries despite producers’ capital discipline. The \\nresulting spare capacity is likely to limit upside \\nagain this year, barring major supply disruptions.   \\n\\n\\nOutside of commonly traded commodity \\nindices, there were a couple bright spots. Uranium \\nsaw a strong rally, gaining 90% last year. We \\ncontinue to recommend a small overweight to \\nuranium, a position we initiated in March 2022 \\nbased on our view that the widening gap between \\nsupply and demand would push prices higher. With \\nsupply being slow to respond despite last year’s \\nrally, we expect uranium prices to rise further \\nthis year. \\n\\n\\nGold also stood out last year, posting a 13% \\nreturn. However, we think the backdrop for gold is \\nmore challenging in 2024, given near-record prices \\nand a more mixed fundamental outlook. \\n\\n\\nOil: Threading the Needle\\n“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into \\ntrouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t \\nso.” That quote, often attributed to Mark Twain, \\nproved apt for oil investors last year, as some \\nwidely expected developments failed to materialize. \\nThe almost universal expectation that oil prices \\nwould surge due to Russian sanctions limiting \\nsupply did not occur. Instead, Russia successfully \\nredirected most of these sanctioned exports to \\nChina and India. Predictions of a slowdown in US \\nproduction growth also missed the mark, as US \\nproducers recorded their fastest growth rate since \\n2019. With these bullish catalysts not happening \\nthe way people thought they would, oil prices \\nended the year with a modest 11% loss.\\n\\n\\nOil begins the year trading at the lower end of \\nits annual range. However, this does not negate the \\npotential downside risks for 2024, as we anticipate \\nchallenges stemming from both demand and \\nsupply dynamics. Sustaining the recent demand \\ngrowth rate will be challenging now that the post-\\npandemic recovery has largely run its course. We \\npredict that demand growth will return to a trend-\\nlike pace of 1.0–1.5 million b/d this year in the \\nabsence of a recession, a significant deceleration \\nfrom last year’s 2.3 million b/d increase (see \\nExhibit 173).\\n\\n\\nThis slower demand growth will likely require \\nrestraint on the part of producers to keep the \\nmarket in balance. For their part, US producers \\nhave consistently demonstrated discipline in their \\nallocation of capital. Over the last 12 months, these \\nproducers have returned 49% of their cash flows \\nto investors compared to 37% per year between \\n2014 and 2019. However, productivity has also \\nimproved in recent years, such that the same dollar \\nof capital spending now generates more oil. As a \\nresult, US production is likely to continue growing \\ndespite ongoing capital discipline. \\n\\n\\nThe potential for output restraint among other \\nnon-OPEC producers is just as dubious. Brazil, \\nGuyana and Canada have all experienced a notable \\nuptick in their oil output recently. What’s \\nmore, their production is unlikely to be \\naffected by oil prices, as it stems from \\nyears of investment in offshore and oil \\nsands projects that are just now coming \\nonline. Ultimately, oil production from \\nthese projects could crowd out further \\nexpansion from US shale. \\nThe high prices of commodities \\ncoming into last year proved to be the \\nantidote for even higher prices.\\n\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, the burden of managing \\nsupply relative to demand rests with OPEC, where \\nthere is arguably little room for further reductions. \\nOPEC production already stands at 10-year lows \\nand has been higher than current levels 88% of \\nthe time in the past 20 years73 (see Exhibit 174). \\nSimilarly, the production of Saudi Arabia—often \\nconsidered the ultimate swing producer—has \\nseldom fallen below its current level. Going \\nforward, OPEC’s determination to support prices \\ncould be tested if further production cuts become \\nnecessary. Indeed, at OPEC’s November 2023 \\nmeeting, the decision to further reduce production \\nsparked internal disagreements, leading to Angola’s \\nexit from the organization in protest.\\n\\n\\nConsidering these challenges, we expect WTI \\nprices to trade in a $60–80 range by year-end, \\nimplying minimal upside from current levels. That \\nsaid, we are mindful of several risks that could \\npotentially undermine our forecast. The likelihood \\nof supply disruptions is growing given prevalent \\ngeopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East, as well \\nas instability in countries like Libya and Nigeria. \\nAt the same time, global oil production outages \\nexcluding Russia currently stand near their lowest \\nlevel in 10 years (see Exhibit 175).  While any price \\nspike would likely be temporary given OPEC’s \\nhistorically high spare capacity (see Exhibit 176), \\na spike could still cause significant disruptions in \\nthe short term. There are also legitimate downside \\nrisks to oil prices, including a US recession, an \\nabrupt reversal of OPEC cuts or even a lack of \\nproduction discipline among OPEC members. \\n\\n\\nIn light of these various crosscurrents, we \\ndo not have an active tactical allocation to oil. \\nHowever, we continue to recommend a small \\noverweight position to the US midstream sector, \\nwhich benefits from strong cash flows, growing \\nvolumes and less direct exposure to oil price \\nvolatility.   \\n\\n\\nGold: Breakout Mania\\nThere is nothing quite as captivating to investors as \\na new all-time high—like that reached by gold in \\nlate December last year, when its price hit $2,077. \\nThis milestone not only fueled expectations for \\nfurther gains, but also reinforced investors’ faith \\nin several bullish catalysts for gold. These included \\nso-called de-dollarization of central banks’ \\nreserves, falling interest rates and investors’ search \\nfor safe-haven assets in times of global uncertainty. \\n\\n\\nBut as investors, we must avoid fitting a \\nnarrative to an asset’s price movements. Gold \\ndid indeed rally alongside bonds late last year, \\nbut the catalyst for the bond move was signs \\nof moderating inflation—whereas gold has the \\nreputation of being an inflation hedge. Moreover, \\nmost assets rallied during last year’s fourth quarter: \\ngold’s 11.6% return was similar to the 11.7% \\ngain of US equities but higher than the 6.8% \\nadvance of the US aggregate bond index. It is also \\nworth highlighting that this isn’t gold’s first time \\nsurpassing $2,000. In fact, it also exceeded this \\nlevel in August 2020 and March 2022, but reversed \\ncourse shortly after on both occasions. \\n\\n\\nFor the year ahead, we see several crosscurrents \\nimpacting the outlook for gold. To be sure, gold \\nhas a few supportive factors. There is scope for \\ninvestors to increase their ETF exposure to gold, \\nas current positions are more than 25 million \\nounces below their 2020 peak (see Exhibit 177). \\nEmerging market central banks are also increasing \\ntheir exposure, as they continue to diversify some \\nof their reserves into gold. Based on data up to the \\nthird quarter of last year, these central banks added \\naround 1,000 tonnes of gold to their balance sheets \\nlast year, accounting for nearly 30% of global gold \\nproduction. However, this is not an incremental \\nsource of demand, as they purchased about the \\nsame amount the previous year (see Exhibit 178). \\n\\n\\nAs was the case last year, our expectation \\nfor lower nominal interest rates could also \\nbenefit gold. Recall that lower rates reduce the \\nopportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t \\nyield any income and needs to be stored, often \\nat a cost. This interest rate dynamic can also be \\nindirectly observed through gold’s positive reaction \\nto past Federal Reserve rate cuts. In fact, in the six \\nmonths following the first rate cut of a cycle, gold \\nprices have rallied 60% of the time, by a median of \\n6.2% (see Exhibit 179). \\n\\n\\nHowever, the fact that disinflation is pushing \\ninterest rates lower could weaken this dynamic. That \\nhas been the case historically, as real interest rates \\nhave been a more important driver of gold prices \\nthan nominal interest rates. Falling but positive real \\nrates, which we expect this year, have historically \\nbeen roughly neutral for gold prices compared to \\ntheir unconditional performance. Capitalizing on \\nthese rate movements also requires precise timing, as \\nthe median gold return in the six months before the \\nfirst Federal Reserve rate cut has been a 1.9% loss, \\nwith only a 50% chance of a gain. \\n\\n\\nWe do not expect the US dollar \\nto provide a clear catalyst to gold \\nprices either. While there is a negative \\ncorrelation between gold and the \\ndollar, it has historically taken a large \\ndollar depreciation to push gold prices \\nmeaningfully higher, which is not our \\ncentral case. In fact, we expect the dollar \\nto appreciate this year. \\nThere is nothing quite as captivating \\nto investors as a new all-time high—\\nlike that reached by gold in late \\nDecember last year.\\n\\n\\nIn short, we do not believe these conflicting \\nfactors convincingly justify today’s already high \\ngold prices, leaving us neutral until a clearer \\nopportunity presents itself.

       " Document(id='2025 Outlook', metadata={}, page_content='Commodity markets often change the locks just \\nwhen investors think they have found the keys. \\nRecent years have been no exception: investors \\ngained confidence after two consecutive years of \\nexcess returns in 2021 and 2022—fueled by supply \\nchain disruptions, rising inflation and Russia’s \\ninvasion of Ukraine—only to be caught off guard \\nby losses in 2023 and just a modest rebound last \\nyear. The GSCI’s 4% return in 2024 also masked \\nuneven performance across subsectors. Gains in \\nprecious metals and livestock weren’t enough to \\noffset losses in agriculture and industrial metals.\\n\\n\\nThe relative stability in energy prices last year \\nstood in stark contrast to pervasive geopolitical \\nrisks and moderating demand growth. This \\nresilience reflected historically high spare capacity \\nin oil markets, which helped balance declining \\ninventories and modest periodic disruptions. \\nLooking ahead, we expect steady global economic \\ngrowth to support demand, while ample spare \\ncapacity should again keep prices in check, barring \\na major supply disruption.\\n\\n\\nGold emerged as a standout performer last \\nyear, reaching a new all-time high in October and \\noutperforming the S&P 500 with a 27% spot \\nreturn. Its strength was driven by a combination of \\nfactors, including elevated central bank purchases, \\nmonetary easing, rising national debt concerns and \\ngeopolitical risks.\\n\\n\\nWhile we remain neutral on commodities \\noverall, we continue to recommend a small \\noverweight to uranium, which we believe offers \\nattractive asymmetry given an ongoing structural \\ndeficit (see Section I, Our Tactical Tilts).\\n\\n\\nOil: Uneasy Equilibrium\\nOil did not live up to its reputation for volatility \\nin 2024. Prices traded within their tightest range \\nsince 2013 in percentage terms and within their \\nnarrowest range since 1998 in real dollar terms. \\nWTI crude oil spent nearly 80% of 2024 within \\nour expected trading range of $60–80 and ended \\nthe year flat. This uncharacteristic stability reflected \\na balanced oil market, where ample spare capacity, \\ndisciplined production and moderating demand \\ngrowth combined to offset geopolitical risks.  \\n\\n\\nSupply disruptions remained modest despite \\nactive military conflicts in the Middle East \\nand Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. OPEC+ \\nmaintained remarkable discipline, extending \\nproduction cut agreements through 2026 and \\npostponing plans to unwind cuts. This resulted \\nin historically high spare capacity, providing a \\nbuffer against unexpected supply shocks (see \\nExhibit 183). Meanwhile, global oil demand \\ngrowth slowed for a third straight year, even as \\nconsumption demand recovered from pandemic \\ndistortions and reached a new all-time high.\\n\\n\\nLooking ahead to 2025, we expect trend-like \\nglobal economic activity to drive oil demand \\nhigher by around 1 million b/d, similar to last \\nyear. However, Chinese demand growth is likely to \\nremain subdued at around 0.1–0.2 million b/d due \\nto its slower economic growth (see Section II) and \\na shift away from petroleum-consuming passenger \\nand freight transportation vehicles. This would \\nleave China’s demand growth trailing India’s for a \\nsecond year (see Exhibit 184).\\n\\n\\nTo keep the market in balance, oil supply will \\nneed to increase to meet demand growth. Increased \\noil production is most likely to come from among \\nnon-OPEC+ countries, which now contribute the \\nmajority of global oil supply (see Exhibit 185). \\nIndeed, the approximately 1.2 million b/d in supply \\ngrowth we expect from countries such as the US, \\nGuyana, Brazil and Canada is sufficient to satisfy \\nglobal demand growth on its own. Moreover, much \\nof this expected growth arises from large-scale \\noffshore developments whose production is not \\nsensitive to market oil prices. \\n\\n\\nGiven this non-OPEC+ growth, the burden of \\nmanaging supply relative to demand rests with \\nOPEC+. We expect the group to maintain its recent \\nsupply discipline this year unless prices move \\nsustainably higher. This should ensure ample spare \\ncapacity to absorb unexpected disruptions. \\n\\n\\nGiven a roughly balanced oil market, we \\nexpect WTI crude oil prices to end 2025 in a range \\nof $60–80, consistent with the current forward \\ncurve and last year’s range. That said, risks to our \\noutlook remain. OPEC’s spare capacity provides a \\ntangible buffer, but the oil market’s other buffer—\\nobservable global oil inventories—is near multiyear \\nlows (see Exhibit 186). Additionally, OPEC+ could \\nchoose not to respond swiftly to a supply shock, \\nwhile weaker global demand, a lapse in OPEC+ \\nproduction discipline and larger-than-expected \\nnon-OPEC+ production growth could also test \\nmarket stability. \\n\\n\\nPolicy uncertainty also looms. The incoming \\nTrump administration may tighten sanctions on \\nIran, Russia and Venezuela, but is likely to prioritize \\nlow energy prices—balancing geopolitical objectives \\nwith domestic economic considerations. Meanwhile, \\nwhile deregulation could increase oil drilling \\npermits, logistical bottlenecks and US producers’ \\ncapital discipline make a production surge unlikely. \\n\\n\\nGiven these crosscurrents, we do not hold an \\nactive tactical position in oil currently. Instead, \\nwe continue to recommend a small overweight to \\nthe US midstream sector, which offers strong cash \\nflows, benefits from growing energy volumes and \\nhas less direct exposure to oil price volatility.\\nGold: Golden Crossroads\\nNo other commodity shined as brightly as gold \\nlast year, with its 27% surge marking the best \\nannual performance in a decade. Gold’s strength \\nwas notable for reflecting familiar drivers—\\nsizable central bank purchases, easier monetary \\npolicy, rising national debt levels and pervasive \\ngeopolitical risks—while also defying traditional \\nheadwinds, including rising real interest rates and a \\nstronger US dollar. Last year marked only the third \\ntime since 1997 in which gold rallied despite these \\nheadwinds, although its inverse correlation with \\nUS real interest rates has weakened in recent years \\n(see Exhibit 187). \\n\\n\\nThis breakdown of once-reliable relationships \\nunderscores a notable shift in the appeal of gold \\namong key buyers. Central banks—particularly in \\ncountries such as China, India and Türkiye—have \\nsharply increased gold purchases in recent years \\nas part of broader efforts to diversify foreign \\nexchange reserves and reduce reliance on the US \\ndollar. Heightened trade uncertainty, geopolitical \\ntensions, and the US dollar’s use in sanctions \\nhave further bolstered gold’s appeal in these \\nbuyers’ eyes. \\n\\n\\nGlobal central bank purchases of gold topped \\n1,000 tonnes in 2022–23 and were on track \\nto reach similar levels again late last year (see \\nExhibit 188). Consumer demand in emerging \\nmarkets has also surged, driven by gold’s enduring \\nreputation as both a store of value and a hedge \\nagainst geopolitical risk. Collectively, this \\ndemand has supported prices even amid volatile \\nmacroeconomic conditions. \\n\\n\\nThe renewed enthusiasm for gold is also visible \\nin investor positioning. While ETF holdings of \\ngold in volume terms actually declined in 2024, \\ntheir value in dollars reached an all-time high. \\nSimilarly, net speculative positioning in the futures \\nand options markets remains elevated, standing \\nin its 88th percentile since 1995. All told, global \\ninvestment demand accounted for about a quarter \\nof gold purchases through the third quarter of last \\nyear, roughly in line with long-run averages but \\nhigher than levels seen in 2021–23.\\n\\n\\nThe macroeconomic backdrop presents a \\nmore mixed outlook for gold. We forecast positive \\nbut falling real interest rates this year, which \\nhave historically been neutral for gold relative \\nto unconditional returns (see Exhibit 189). We \\nalso expect a modestly stronger dollar, which has \\nhistorically limited meaningful gold appreciation. \\nThat said, the reliability of both of these macro \\ndrivers has weakened in recent years, as discussed. \\n\\n\\nOn balance, these crosscurrents leave us neutral \\non gold prices from current levels. Central banks \\nhave been net buyers of gold for over a decade, \\nsuggesting their demand may be structural. \\nHowever, with gold already near all-time highs \\nand investors positioned for further upside, price \\nsensitivity among buyers is likely to increase.

      "\n",
      "**Document Summary:**\n",
      "The 2023 Outlook discusses the performance and future expectations for commodities, particularly focusing on oil and gold. In 2022, commodities, led by the S&P GSCI's 23% return, outperformed other asset classes, although this was marked by significant volatility and disparities among individual commodities. Energy prices surged due to geopolitical tensions, particularly from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but have since retreated due to various bearish factors, including a release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve and declining demand from China.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document highlights the precarious balance between supply-side pressures and demand concerns, particularly in light of low global inventories and potential geopolitical disruptions. It anticipates that oil prices will fluctuate between $70 and $100 per barrel, influenced by various risks, including a possible US recession and ongoing geopolitical tensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, gold's reputation as an inflation hedge has diminished, with prices remaining low despite high inflation rates. The report suggests a neutral stance on gold, citing factors such as rising interest rates and a strong US dollar that typically suppress gold prices. However, potential demand from central banks and safe-haven buying during economic downturns could provide some support for gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the document presents a cautious outlook for commodities, emphasizing the need to navigate the complex interplay of supply, demand, and geopolitical factors.\n",

      "**Document title: 2024 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The 2024 Outlook presents a stark contrast to the previous year's document, highlighting a significant downturn in commodity performance, with the GSCI falling 9% in 2023 compared to the previous years' strong returns. The document notes that high commodity prices in prior years led to increased supply and demand conservation, particularly in oil, which saw production exceed expectations despite capital discipline among producers. This has resulted in spare capacity that may limit price increases in 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "While uranium emerged as a bright spot with a 90% rally, the outlook for oil is cautious, predicting a trading range of $60–80 per barrel due to slower demand growth and potential supply challenges. The document emphasizes that OPEC's ability to manage production is under pressure, with internal disagreements and low production levels complicating the landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold, which posted a 13% return last year, faces a more challenging environment in 2024. The document discusses the mixed fundamental outlook for gold, noting that while there are supportive factors such as increased central bank purchases and potential lower interest rates, the high current prices and the expectation of a stronger US dollar may hinder significant gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the 2024 Outlook reflects a more cautious and complex environment for commodities compared to the previous document, which had a more optimistic tone regarding the potential for price increases in oil and gold. The new document underscores the need for careful navigation of supply-demand dynamics and geopolitical uncertainties, contrasting with the previous year's focus on a potential supercycle in commodities.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The 2025 Outlook builds on the cautious tone established in the 2024 Outlook, reflecting ongoing complexities in the commodity markets. While the GSCI saw a modest 4% return in 2024, the performance was uneven across subsectors, with gains in precious metals and livestock not compensating for losses in agriculture and industrial metals. This contrasts with the previous document's focus on a significant downturn in commodity performance in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy prices exhibited relative stability in 2024, a departure from the volatility typically associated with oil markets. The document notes that high spare capacity and disciplined production helped maintain this balance, while geopolitical risks persisted. This stability is a shift from the previous year's concerns about OPEC's management of production and the potential for price increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold emerged as a standout performer in 2024, achieving a 27% return, driven by factors such as central bank purchases and geopolitical tensions. This marks a notable improvement compared to the previous document, which highlighted a more challenging environment for gold in 2024. However, the 2025 Outlook expresses a neutral stance on gold prices moving forward, acknowledging potential headwinds from rising real interest rates and a stronger dollar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outlook for oil remains cautious, with expectations of steady demand growth but also a need for increased supply to maintain market balance. The document emphasizes the role of non-OPEC+ countries in meeting this demand, contrasting with the previous document's focus on OPEC's production discipline. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the 2025 Outlook reflects a nuanced view of the commodity landscape, maintaining a cautious approach while recognizing some positive developments, particularly in gold, compared to the more pessimistic tone of the 2024 Outlook.\n",

As seen in Exhibit 181, close \\nto 10% of global oil production found itself at \\nrisk of disruption virtually overnight in the wake \\nof Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing \\nrollout of Western sanctions. Given already low \\nglobal oil inventories and thin spare capacity, oil \\nprices understandably spiked higher, reaching $124 \\nat their peak closing level last March. \\n\\n\\nPrices have since fallen back below pre-war \\nlevels. This surprising retracement reflects not only \\nthe failure of supply risks to materialize, but also \\na combination of bearish developments, including \\nan unprecedented 200-million-barrel release from \\nthe US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a COVID-\\ndriven slump in Chinese oil demand and fears of \\nan impending recession.Although oil prices have receded, the bullish \\nrisks that underpinned their initial spike higher \\nhave not disappeared. The full effect of European \\nsanctions on Russia will not be visible in energy \\nmarkets until the first quarter of this year. These \\ncurbs directly impact 0.5 million b/d of seaborne \\ncrude oil and 1.1 million b/d of refined products. \\nWhile Russia has so far been successful at \\nredirecting crude exports to India and China, this \\nstrategy is starting to show some limits (see Exhibit \\n182).

Instead, Russia successfully \\nredirected most of these sanctioned exports to \\nChina and India. Predictions of a slowdown in US \\nproduction growth also missed the mark, as US \\nproducers recorded their fastest growth rate since \\n2019. With these bullish catalysts not happening \\nthe way people thought they would, oil prices \\nended the year with a modest 11% loss.Oil begins the year trading at the lower end of \\nits annual range. However, this does not negate the \\npotential downside risks for 2024, as we anticipate \\nchallenges stemming from both demand and \\nsupply dynamics. Sustaining the recent demand \\ngrowth rate will be challenging now that the post-\\npandemic recovery has largely run its course. We \\npredict that demand growth will return to a trend-\\nlike pace of 1.0–1.5 million b/d this year in the \\nabsence of a recession, a significant deceleration \\nfrom last year’s 2.3 million b/d increase (see \\nExhibit 173).This slower demand growth will likely require \\nrestraint on the part of producers to keep the \\nmarket in balance. For their part, US producers \\nhave consistently demonstrated discipline in their \\nallocation of capital. Over the last 12 months, these \\nproducers have returned 49% of their cash flows \\nto investors compared to 37% per year between \\n2014 and 2019. However, productivity has also \\nimproved in recent years, such that the same dollar \\nof capital spending now generates more oil. As a \\nresult, US production is likely to continue growing \\ndespite ongoing capital discipline.The potential for output restraint among other \\nnon-OPEC producers is just as dubious. Brazil, \\nGuyana and Canada have all experienced a notable \\nuptick in their oil output recently. What’s \\nmore, their production is unlikely to be \\naffected by oil prices, as it stems from \\nyears of investment in offshore and oil \\nsands projects that are just now coming \\nonline. Ultimately, oil production from \\nthese projects could crowd out further \\nexpansion from US shale. \\nThe high prices of commodities \\ncoming into last year proved to be the \\nantidote for even higher prices.Against this backdrop, the burden of managing \\nsupply relative to demand rests with OPEC, where \\nthere is arguably little room for further reductions. \\nOPEC production already stands at 10-year lows \\nand has been higher than current levels 88% of \\nthe time in the past 20 years73 (see Exhibit 174). \\nSimilarly, the production of Saudi Arabia—often \\nconsidered the ultimate swing producer—has \\nseldom fallen below its current level. Going \\nforward, OPEC’s determination to support prices \\ncould be tested if further production cuts become \\nnecessary.

But \\nthat reputation was tarnished in 2022, as gold \\nprices spent most of the year trading in negative \\nterritory despite the highest inflation in four \\ndecades. This disappointing performance was \\nyet another reminder that gold is subject to a \\nmultitude of often opposing factors. Case in point: \\nthe impact of last year’s inflation surprise was \\nlargely offset by the combination of higher interest \\nrates and the surge in the US dollar, with which \\ngold tends to be negatively correlated.These types of crosscurrents leave us tactically \\nneutral on gold again this year. As seen in Exhibit \\n185, our expectation for softer nominal and \\nreal interest rates removes one of last year’s key \\nheadwinds to gold. Yet real rates are still likely \\nto remain in positive territory, which historically \\nhas resulted in lower-than-average gold returns \\n(see Exhibit 186). After all, positive interest rates \\ncreate an opportunity cost of holding gold, which \\ngenerates no cash flow or yield income and must \\nbe physically stored, often at a cost.We also do not see a compelling argument for \\ninvestors to replace their US dollar holdings with \\ngold this year, given our still constructive view on \\nthe currency. Consider that since 1971, there has \\nbeen only a 24% chance of a meaningful gold \\nrally of more than 10% in periods when the dollar \\nwas stable or rising. In fact, most meaningful \\ngold rallies have happened when the US dollar \\nwas depreciating. Put simply, when the dollar is \\nappreciating—a situation we expect this year—\\nthe low probability of strong gold returns has \\nnot historically justified the risk and volatility of \\nholding the yellow metal.Still, there are a few factors that could buoy \\ngold, not the least of which is a US recession that \\nmight rekindle demand for gold as a safe-haven \\nasset. Gold also stands to benefit if currently \\nunderweight investors increase their positions \\n(see Exhibit 187), which now stand 28% below \\ntheir recent peak in early 2022 and back at levels \\nlast seen in early 2020.

There is scope for \\ninvestors to increase their ETF exposure to gold, \\nas current positions are more than 25 million \\nounces below their 2020 peak (see Exhibit 177). \\nEmerging market central banks are also increasing \\ntheir exposure, as they continue to diversify some \\nof their reserves into gold. Based on data up to the \\nthird quarter of last year, these central banks added \\naround 1,000 tonnes of gold to their balance sheets \\nlast year, accounting for nearly 30% of global gold \\nproduction. However, this is not an incremental \\nsource of demand, as they purchased about the \\nsame amount the previous year (see Exhibit 178).As was the case last year, our expectation \\nfor lower nominal interest rates could also \\nbenefit gold. Recall that lower rates reduce the \\nopportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t \\nyield any income and needs to be stored, often \\nat a cost. This interest rate dynamic can also be \\nindirectly observed through gold’s positive reaction \\nto past Federal Reserve rate cuts. In fact, in the six \\nmonths following the first rate cut of a cycle, gold \\nprices have rallied 60% of the time, by a median of \\n6.2% (see Exhibit 179).However, the fact that disinflation is pushing \\ninterest rates lower could weaken this dynamic. That \\nhas been the case historically, as real interest rates \\nhave been a more important driver of gold prices \\nthan nominal interest rates. Falling but positive real \\nrates, which we expect this year, have historically \\nbeen roughly neutral for gold prices compared to \\ntheir unconditional performance.

While there is a negative \\ncorrelation between gold and the \\ndollar, it has historically taken a large \\ndollar depreciation to push gold prices \\nmeaningfully higher, which is not our \\ncentral case.

However, this overall gain masked significant volatility, as returns peaked at 54% by June before dropping in the latter half of the year. There was considerable variation among individual commodities; while the energy subindex saw a notable 39% increase, primarily driven by positive carry from backwardation, both industrial and precious metals experienced losses.

This downturn was widespread, affecting energy, agriculture, and industrial metals. High commodity prices from the previous year prompted demand conservation and increased supply capacity, particularly in the oil sector, which limited price increases despite high production levels. \n",

This contrasts with the previous document's 2024 Outlook, which noted a decline in the GSCI and highlighted the uneven performance across various sectors. While precious metals and livestock showed gains, losses in agriculture and industrial metals persisted, indicating ongoing volatility similar to the previous year's trends.\n",

      "Gold emerged as a standout performer in 2024, achieving a 27% return, driven by central bank purchases and geopolitical concerns, marking a significant improvement compared to the previous year's 13% return. This highlights a shift in the outlook for gold, which was previously seen as less favorable due to high prices. The recommendation for a small overweight in the US midstream sector reflects a strategic pivot away from direct oil exposure, contrasting with the previous document's focus on uranium and gold as key sectors.\n",

This situation makes prices sensitive to supply disruptions, particularly in politically unstable regions like South America, Russia, and the Middle East. The outlook for industrial metals and oil prices is balanced, with expectations for WTI prices to range between $70 and $100 by year-end, although various risks, including a potential US recession or renewed COVID-19 waves, could lower prices to around $60 temporarily. The document expresses skepticism about gold's effectiveness as a hedge against inflation or political risk. It also recommends a small overweight in the US midstream sector due to its strong cash flows and reduced exposure to oil price fluctuations.\n",

      "**Document Summary:**\n",
      "The 2024 Outlook document revises the forecast for WTI oil prices, projecting a trading range of $60–80 by year-end, which indicates a more conservative outlook compared to the previous document's expectation of $70–100. The document highlights increasing risks of supply disruptions due to geopolitical instability in the Middle East and countries like Libya and Nigeria, while noting that global oil production outages, excluding Russia, are at a decade low. Despite the potential for temporary price spikes due to OPEC's high spare capacity, the document emphasizes significant downside risks, including a possible US recession and OPEC's production discipline. Similar to the previous document, it maintains a recommendation for a small overweight in the US midstream sector due to its strong cash flows and reduced exposure to oil price fluctuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to the previous document's skepticism about gold, the new document presents a more optimistic view, highlighting gold's recent all-time high of $2,077 and the bullish catalysts driving investor interest, such as de-dollarization, falling interest rates, and the search for safe-haven assets amid global uncertainty. This marks a notable shift in perspective regarding gold's role as an investment.\n",

      "**Document Summary:**\n",
      "The 2025 Outlook document maintains a neutral stance on commodities overall but continues to recommend a small overweight in uranium due to its attractive asymmetry stemming from an ongoing structural deficit. In terms of oil, the document notes that prices exhibited unusual stability in 2024, trading within their tightest range since 2013 and ending the year flat, contrasting with the previous document's projection of a more volatile market. WTI crude oil prices are expected to remain in the same $60–80 range by year-end 2025, consistent with the previous year's forecast. \n",

      "Key similarities with the 2024 Outlook include the continued emphasis on the $60–80 price range for WTI crude oil and the acknowledgment of geopolitical risks, although the 2025 document highlights a more balanced oil market due to disciplined production and moderating demand growth. Differences arise in the tone regarding oil market volatility; the 2025 document reflects a more stable outlook compared to the previous document's concerns about potential price spikes and significant downside risks.

      "The 2023 Outlook discusses the conflicting dynamics in commodity markets, particularly oil, driven by supply-side bullishness and demand-side bearishness. Despite years of underinvestment supporting commodity prices, a potential global economic slowdown, especially in China, poses risks to demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oil prices surged last year due to geopolitical tensions, notably the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which threatened nearly 10% of global oil production. Prices peaked at $124 but have since fallen below pre-war levels due to a lack of supply disruptions, a significant release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, decreased Chinese demand, and recession fears. \n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of European sanctions on Russian oil will become clearer in early 2023, with potential risks to 2 million barrels per day of Russian supply to Europe. While demand from China declined last year, a successful reopening could boost global demand, which is expected to exceed pre-COVID levels by year-end. However, US production growth is contingent on maintaining high oil prices to incentivize drilling, as OPEC has limited spare capacity. Recent price drops have already led to reduced US drilling activity and OPEC's production cuts to stabilize prices.\n",
      "**New Document Title: 2024 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Document Summary:**\n",
      "The 2024 Outlook, titled \"Oil: Threading the Needle,\" reflects on the unexpected developments in the oil market over the past year, contrasting sharply with the previous year's expectations. Unlike the anticipated surge in oil prices due to Russian sanctions, Russia successfully redirected its exports to China and India, resulting in a modest 11% loss in oil prices by year-end. This marks a significant deviation from the previous document's projection of bullish catalysts stemming from geopolitical tensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the year begins, oil prices are at the lower end of their annual range, with potential downside risks anticipated for 2024. Demand growth is expected to decelerate to a trend-like pace of 1.0–1.5 million barrels per day, down from last year's 2.3 million barrels per day increase, reflecting the end of the post-pandemic recovery. This slower growth necessitates restraint from producers, although US producers have shown capital discipline, returning 49% of cash flows to investors compared to 37% from 2014 to 2019. Despite this discipline, improved productivity suggests continued growth in US production.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to the previous document's focus on OPEC's limited spare capacity, the 2024 Outlook highlights the increasing output from non-OPEC producers like Brazil, Guyana, and Canada, which may crowd out US shale expansion. OPEC's production is at a 10-year low, and internal disagreements have emerged regarding further production cuts, particularly following Angola's exit from the organization. This situation underscores the challenges OPEC faces in managing supply relative to demand, a shift from the previous document's emphasis on the potential impact of European sanctions on Russian oil supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while both documents address the complexities of the oil market, the 2024 Outlook presents a more nuanced view of supply dynamics and the unexpected resilience of Russian exports, contrasting with the previous year's more straightforward bullish and bearish narratives.\n",
      "**New Document Title: 2025 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Document Summary:**\n",
      "The 2025 Outlook continues to explore the complexities of the oil market, building on insights from the 2024 Outlook. While the previous document noted a modest demand growth of 1.0–1.5 million barrels per day (b/d) and highlighted the challenges faced by OPEC, the 2025 Outlook presents a more stable scenario with global oil demand growth projected at around 1 million b/d, similar to the previous year. This growth is attributed to a recovery in consumption demand, despite a subdued increase in Chinese demand due to slower economic growth and a shift away from petroleum-based transportation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to the 2024 Outlook's emphasis on the increasing output from non-OPEC producers, the 2025 Outlook underscores the significant role of non-OPEC+ countries in meeting global demand growth, with expected supply increases primarily from the US, Guyana, Brazil, and Canada. This shift indicates a continued trend where non-OPEC+ nations contribute the majority of global oil supply, alleviating some pressure on OPEC+ to manage production cuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "OPEC+ has demonstrated remarkable discipline by extending production cut agreements through 2026, maintaining historically high spare capacity to buffer against supply shocks. This contrasts with the previous document's focus on OPEC's internal disagreements and production challenges. The 2025 Outlook suggests that OPEC+ will likely continue its disciplined approach unless there is a significant and sustained increase in oil prices.\n",

      "The document discusses the current outlook for gold as an investment, highlighting its historical reputation as a hedge against inflation, which was challenged in 2022 when gold prices remained low despite high inflation. The decline in gold prices was attributed to rising interest rates and a strong US dollar, which negatively impacts gold's appeal. The authors maintain a neutral stance on gold for 2023, noting that while softer nominal and real interest rates may alleviate some pressures, positive real rates typically lead to lower gold returns due to the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding asset. The document emphasizes that gold rallies are less likely when the dollar is stable or appreciating, a scenario expected this year. However, potential factors that could support gold prices include a US recession, increased demand from underweight investors, and central banks in emerging markets diversifying their reserves into gold. Despite these possibilities, the authors conclude that they will remain neutral on gold until more favorable conditions arise.\n",
      "**Document Title: 2024 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The 2024 Outlook document builds on the previous year's analysis of gold as an investment, noting that while gold experienced an 11.6% return in the last quarter of 2023, similar to US equities, it still faces a complex set of influences. Unlike the previous document, which emphasized the challenges posed by rising interest rates and a strong dollar, this document highlights the potential for increased ETF exposure and central bank purchases as supportive factors for gold. Emerging market central banks added approximately 1,000 tonnes of gold to their reserves in 2023, maintaining a steady demand level.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document reiterates the importance of interest rates, suggesting that lower nominal rates could benefit gold by reducing the opportunity cost of holding it. However, it also warns that disinflation may weaken this dynamic, as real interest rates—expected to remain positive—have historically been more influential on gold prices. The authors express skepticism about the dollar's role in driving gold prices higher, predicting its appreciation rather than depreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while the 2024 Outlook acknowledges some supportive factors for gold, it maintains a neutral stance, similar to the previous document, due to conflicting influences and the current high price of gold. The authors conclude that they will remain neutral until clearer opportunities arise, mirroring the cautious approach taken in the 2023 Outlook.\n",
      "**Document Title: 2025 Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The 2025 Outlook document continues the analysis of gold as an investment, reflecting on the evolving dynamics of demand from central banks and investors. Similar to the 2024 Outlook, it notes that central banks, particularly in China, India, and Türkiye, have significantly increased their gold purchases to diversify reserves and reduce dependence on the US dollar. This trend is driven by heightened trade uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, reinforcing gold's status as a safe-haven asset.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the previous document highlighted a steady demand from emerging market central banks, the 2025 Outlook emphasizes that global central bank purchases exceeded 1,000 tonnes in 2022-23 and are expected to remain robust. Consumer demand in emerging markets is also noted to have surged, supporting gold prices amid macroeconomic volatility. However, unlike the 2024 Outlook, which indicated a potential for increased ETF exposure, the 2025 document reveals a decline in ETF holdings by volume, although their dollar value reached an all-time high, indicating a shift in investor sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The macroeconomic environment remains mixed, with forecasts of positive but declining real interest rates, which have historically been neutral for gold returns. The expectation of a stronger dollar, similar to the previous document, is noted to potentially limit gold's appreciation. Despite these challenges, the 2025 Outlook maintains a neutral stance on gold prices, echoing the cautious approach of the 2024 document, while acknowledging that central bank demand may be structural. However, it warns that with gold prices near all-time highs and increased investor positioning for further gains, price sensitivity among buyers is likely to rise.\n",
