       "[Document(id='2023', metadata={}, page_content='Commodities were a bright spot for markets last \\nyear (see Exhibit 180). The S&P GSCI returned \\n23%, topping all other major asset classes for a \\nsecond consecutive year. But this impressive gain \\nbelied a more nuanced reality, as returns reached \\n54% by early June, only to be halved in the \\nsecond half of the year. Investors also faced a wide \\ndispersion among individual commodities and their \\nsource of returns. In contrast to the index’s overall \\nstrength, both industrial metals and precious \\nmetals suffered losses last year. And while the \\nenergy subindex outperformed with a 39% gain, \\nthe bulk of this came from positive carry, or the \\nadditional return holders of a commodity get when \\nthe futures curve is strongly downward sloping, \\ncalled “backwardation.” The appreciation in spot \\nenergy prices was a much smaller 14%.  \\n\\n\\nThe disjointed nature of these returns reflects \\nthe tug-of-war between bullish supply-side \\npressures and bearish demand-side concerns that is \\nlikely to continue in the year ahead. Although years \\nof underinvestment are an underlying support for \\nmany commodity prices, a deeper global economic \\nslowdown could quickly undermine demand, \\nespecially given the still-uncertain trajectory of \\nChina’s economy amid its shifting COVID policies. \\n\\n\\nAgainst these risks, we note that global \\ninventories have remained low across most \\ncommodities despite months of weak Chinese \\ndemand—a sign of equally weak supply trends. A \\nthinner inventory buffer also leaves prices sensitive \\nto potential supply disruptions in politically \\nunstable areas, such as South America for base \\nmetals, or—discussed further below—Russia and \\nthe Middle East for oil. Given these crosscurrents, \\nwe believe that risks around our base case are \\nroughly balanced for industrial metals and oil \\nprices this year. As for gold, we remain doubtful \\nabout its ability to provide investors with a reliable \\nhedge against inflation or political risk given its \\nnotable failure to do so in the past year.  \\n\\n\\nOil: High Risks, Low Inventories\\nOil prices last year were driven by geopolitical \\ndevelopments to a degree not seen since the \\nturbulent 1970s. As seen in Exhibit 181, close \\nto 10% of global oil production found itself at \\nrisk of disruption virtually overnight in the wake \\nof Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing \\nrollout of Western sanctions. Given already low \\nglobal oil inventories and thin spare capacity, oil \\nprices understandably spiked higher, reaching $124 \\nat their peak closing level last March. \\n\\n\\nPrices have since fallen back below pre-war \\nlevels. This surprising retracement reflects not only \\nthe failure of supply risks to materialize, but also \\na combination of bearish developments, including \\nan unprecedented 200-million-barrel release from \\nthe US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a COVID-\\ndriven slump in Chinese oil demand and fears of \\nan impending recession. \\n\\n\\nAlthough oil prices have receded, the bullish \\nrisks that underpinned their initial spike higher \\nhave not disappeared. The full effect of European \\nsanctions on Russia will not be visible in energy \\nmarkets until the first quarter of this year. These \\ncurbs directly impact 0.5 million b/d of seaborne \\ncrude oil and 1.1 million b/d of refined products. \\nWhile Russia has so far been successful at \\nredirecting crude exports to India and China, this \\nstrategy is starting to show some limits (see Exhibit \\n182). Moreover, it will be difficult for Russia to \\nreplicate this strategy in refined products, as both \\nChina and India were net exporters in this category \\nlast year.\\n\\n\\nAs a result, close to 2 million b/d of Russian \\nsupplies to Europe remain at risk. Consensus \\ncurrently expects a net loss of less than half that \\namount, increasing the risk of an upside surprise. \\nUpward pressure on energy prices could also \\narise from supply disruptions in other countries, \\ngiven geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and \\ndomestic instability in Libya and other exporting \\ncountries.  \\n\\n\\nTo be sure, the demand for oil faces an equally \\nhigh degree of risk amid a potential US recession and \\nthe still-uncertain trajectory of China’s economy. We \\nestimate that Chinese demand fell by 0.5 million b/d \\non average last year, marking the first annual decline \\nsince 1990 (see Exhibit 183). While a successful \\nreopening of China’s economy could help offset \\nweaker oil demand elsewhere, a more protracted \\nCOVID wave could exacerbate demand concerns. \\nFor now, we expect global demand to remain on an \\nupward trajectory in our base case, exceeding pre-\\nCOVID levels by year-end.  \\n\\n\\nMeeting this demand will require continuing \\ngrowth from US producers, as OPEC has already \\nramped its output back to pre-COVID levels \\nand has limited spare capacity. But to incentivize \\nadditional drilling, oil prices must remain high \\nenough to overcome the cost inflation and self-\\nimposed capital discipline now holding back \\nUS production. In contrast, lower prices and \\ndisappointing demand would likely restrain \\nproduction growth. Tellingly, the November and \\nDecember oil price slump was rapidly followed by \\na decline in US drilling and completion activity, \\nwhile OPEC immediately announced a production \\ncut to rescue prices. \\n\\n\\nGiven these moving pieces, we expect WTI \\nprices to trade in a $70–100 range by year-end, \\nwhich would imply upside from current levels. \\nBut we are mindful of the many risks that could \\nundermine this forecast—including a US recession, \\nanother wave of global COVID infections or a \\nquick resolution to the conflict in Ukraine—any \\none of which could push prices down to cost \\nsupport near $60. That said, we would not expect \\nthese lower prices to be sustained for an extended \\nperiod, given producers’ likely reaction. There are \\nalso upside risks. Any additional supply disruptions \\nwould be magnified by still-low inventories, which could push prices above our \\nforecast range, as happened last year. \\n\\n\\nAlthough we do not have an active tactical \\nallocation to oil, we do continue to recommend \\na small overweight to the US midstream sector, \\nwhich benefits from strong cash flows and less \\ndirect exposure to oil price volatility.\\n\\n\\nGold: Not as Advertised\\nSince its meteoric rise in the 1970s, gold has been \\nhailed as an effective hedge against inflation. But \\nthat reputation was tarnished in 2022, as gold \\nprices spent most of the year trading in negative \\nterritory despite the highest inflation in four \\ndecades. This disappointing performance was \\nyet another reminder that gold is subject to a \\nmultitude of often opposing factors. Case in point: \\nthe impact of last year’s inflation surprise was \\nlargely offset by the combination of higher interest \\nrates and the surge in the US dollar, with which \\ngold tends to be negatively correlated.\\n\\n\\nThese types of crosscurrents leave us tactically \\nneutral on gold again this year. As seen in Exhibit \\n185, our expectation for softer nominal and \\nreal interest rates removes one of last year’s key \\nheadwinds to gold. Yet real rates are still likely \\nto remain in positive territory, which historically \\nhas resulted in lower-than-average gold returns \\n(see Exhibit 186). After all, positive interest rates \\ncreate an opportunity cost of holding gold, which \\ngenerates no cash flow or yield income and must \\nbe physically stored, often at a cost. \\n\\n\\nWe also do not see a compelling argument for \\ninvestors to replace their US dollar holdings with \\ngold this year, given our still constructive view on \\nthe currency. Consider that since 1971, there has \\nbeen only a 24% chance of a meaningful gold \\nrally of more than 10% in periods when the dollar \\nwas stable or rising. In fact, most meaningful \\ngold rallies have happened when the US dollar \\nwas depreciating. Put simply, when the dollar is \\nappreciating—a situation we expect this year—\\nthe low probability of strong gold returns has \\nnot historically justified the risk and volatility of \\nholding the yellow metal.   \\n\\n\\nStill, there are a few factors that could buoy \\ngold, not the least of which is a US recession that \\nmight rekindle demand for gold as a safe-haven \\nasset. Gold also stands to benefit if currently \\nunderweight investors increase their positions \\n(see Exhibit 187), which now stand 28% below \\ntheir recent peak in early 2022 and back at levels \\nlast seen in early 2020. Demand from EM central \\nbanks looking to diversify their FX reserves into \\ngold is another source of upside risk. The latest \\ndata from the World Gold Council already points \\nto record-high purchases in the most recent \\nquarter, with countries such as Turkey, China and \\nIndia leading the pack. Further geopolitical strife \\ncould even accelerate this trend.  \\n\\n\\nGiven these contradictory factors, we remain \\nneutral on gold until a clearer opportunity \\npresents itself. '),\n",
       " Document(id='2024', metadata={}, page_content='Last year reminded commodity investors that it’s \\nnever wise to count chickens before they hatch. \\nFollowing two years of strong performance that \\nhad reinforced investors’ belief in a new supercycle, \\nthe GSCI instead fell 9% in 2023 (see Exhibit \\n172). The losses were broad-based, with negative \\nprice performance across energy, agriculture and \\nindustrial metals.  \\n\\n\\nThe high prices of commodities coming into \\nlast year proved to be the antidote for even higher \\nprices, as they incentivized a mix of demand \\nconservation, investment in supply capacity and \\nproductivity improvements. This dynamic was \\nparticularly visible in the oil patch last year, where \\nproduction exceeded expectations in several \\ncountries despite producers’ capital discipline. The \\nresulting spare capacity is likely to limit upside \\nagain this year, barring major supply disruptions.   \\n\\n\\nOutside of commonly traded commodity \\nindices, there were a couple bright spots. Uranium \\nsaw a strong rally, gaining 90% last year. We \\ncontinue to recommend a small overweight to \\nuranium, a position we initiated in March 2022 \\nbased on our view that the widening gap between \\nsupply and demand would push prices higher. With \\nsupply being slow to respond despite last year’s \\nrally, we expect uranium prices to rise further \\nthis year. \\n\\n\\nGold also stood out last year, posting a 13% \\nreturn. However, we think the backdrop for gold is \\nmore challenging in 2024, given near-record prices \\nand a more mixed fundamental outlook. \\n\\n\\nOil: Threading the Needle\\n“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into \\ntrouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t \\nso.” That quote, often attributed to Mark Twain, \\nproved apt for oil investors last year, as some \\nwidely expected developments failed to materialize. \\nThe almost universal expectation that oil prices \\nwould surge due to Russian sanctions limiting \\nsupply did not occur. Instead, Russia successfully \\nredirected most of these sanctioned exports to \\nChina and India. Predictions of a slowdown in US \\nproduction growth also missed the mark, as US \\nproducers recorded their fastest growth rate since \\n2019. With these bullish catalysts not happening \\nthe way people thought they would, oil prices \\nended the year with a modest 11% loss.\\n\\n\\nOil begins the year trading at the lower end of \\nits annual range. However, this does not negate the \\npotential downside risks for 2024, as we anticipate \\nchallenges stemming from both demand and \\nsupply dynamics. Sustaining the recent demand \\ngrowth rate will be challenging now that the post-\\npandemic recovery has largely run its course. We \\npredict that demand growth will return to a trend-\\nlike pace of 1.0–1.5 million b/d this year in the \\nabsence of a recession, a significant deceleration \\nfrom last year’s 2.3 million b/d increase (see \\nExhibit 173).\\n\\n\\nThis slower demand growth will likely require \\nrestraint on the part of producers to keep the \\nmarket in balance. For their part, US producers \\nhave consistently demonstrated discipline in their \\nallocation of capital. Over the last 12 months, these \\nproducers have returned 49% of their cash flows \\nto investors compared to 37% per year between \\n2014 and 2019. However, productivity has also \\nimproved in recent years, such that the same dollar \\nof capital spending now generates more oil. As a \\nresult, US production is likely to continue growing \\ndespite ongoing capital discipline. \\n\\n\\nThe potential for output restraint among other \\nnon-OPEC producers is just as dubious. Brazil, \\nGuyana and Canada have all experienced a notable \\nuptick in their oil output recently. What’s \\nmore, their production is unlikely to be \\naffected by oil prices, as it stems from \\nyears of investment in offshore and oil \\nsands projects that are just now coming \\nonline. Ultimately, oil production from \\nthese projects could crowd out further \\nexpansion from US shale. \\nThe high prices of commodities \\ncoming into last year proved to be the \\nantidote for even higher prices.\\n\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, the burden of managing \\nsupply relative to demand rests with OPEC, where \\nthere is arguably little room for further reductions. \\nOPEC production already stands at 10-year lows \\nand has been higher than current levels 88% of \\nthe time in the past 20 years73 (see Exhibit 174). \\nSimilarly, the production of Saudi Arabia—often \\nconsidered the ultimate swing producer—has \\nseldom fallen below its current level. Going \\nforward, OPEC’s determination to support prices \\ncould be tested if further production cuts become \\nnecessary. Indeed, at OPEC’s November 2023 \\nmeeting, the decision to further reduce production \\nsparked internal disagreements, leading to Angola’s \\nexit from the organization in protest.\\n\\n\\nConsidering these challenges, we expect WTI \\nprices to trade in a $60–80 range by year-end, \\nimplying minimal upside from current levels. That \\nsaid, we are mindful of several risks that could \\npotentially undermine our forecast. The likelihood \\nof supply disruptions is growing given prevalent \\ngeopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East, as well \\nas instability in countries like Libya and Nigeria. \\nAt the same time, global oil production outages \\nexcluding Russia currently stand near their lowest \\nlevel in 10 years (see Exhibit 175).  While any price \\nspike would likely be temporary given OPEC’s \\nhistorically high spare capacity (see Exhibit 176), \\na spike could still cause significant disruptions in \\nthe short term. There are also legitimate downside \\nrisks to oil prices, including a US recession, an \\nabrupt reversal of OPEC cuts or even a lack of \\nproduction discipline among OPEC members. \\n\\n\\nIn light of these various crosscurrents, we \\ndo not have an active tactical allocation to oil. \\nHowever, we continue to recommend a small \\noverweight position to the US midstream sector, \\nwhich benefits from strong cash flows, growing \\nvolumes and less direct exposure to oil price \\nvolatility.   \\n\\n\\nGold: Breakout Mania\\nThere is nothing quite as captivating to investors as \\na new all-time high—like that reached by gold in \\nlate December last year, when its price hit $2,077. \\nThis milestone not only fueled expectations for \\nfurther gains, but also reinforced investors’ faith \\nin several bullish catalysts for gold. These included \\nso-called de-dollarization of central banks’ \\nreserves, falling interest rates and investors’ search \\nfor safe-haven assets in times of global uncertainty. \\n\\n\\nBut as investors, we must avoid fitting a \\nnarrative to an asset’s price movements. Gold \\ndid indeed rally alongside bonds late last year, \\nbut the catalyst for the bond move was signs \\nof moderating inflation—whereas gold has the \\nreputation of being an inflation hedge. Moreover, \\nmost assets rallied during last year’s fourth quarter: \\ngold’s 11.6% return was similar to the 11.7% \\ngain of US equities but higher than the 6.8% \\nadvance of the US aggregate bond index. It is also \\nworth highlighting that this isn’t gold’s first time \\nsurpassing $2,000. In fact, it also exceeded this \\nlevel in August 2020 and March 2022, but reversed \\ncourse shortly after on both occasions. \\n\\n\\nFor the year ahead, we see several crosscurrents \\nimpacting the outlook for gold. To be sure, gold \\nhas a few supportive factors. There is scope for \\ninvestors to increase their ETF exposure to gold, \\nas current positions are more than 25 million \\nounces below their 2020 peak (see Exhibit 177). \\nEmerging market central banks are also increasing \\ntheir exposure, as they continue to diversify some \\nof their reserves into gold. Based on data up to the \\nthird quarter of last year, these central banks added \\naround 1,000 tonnes of gold to their balance sheets \\nlast year, accounting for nearly 30% of global gold \\nproduction. However, this is not an incremental \\nsource of demand, as they purchased about the \\nsame amount the previous year (see Exhibit 178). \\n\\n\\nAs was the case last year, our expectation \\nfor lower nominal interest rates could also \\nbenefit gold. Recall that lower rates reduce the \\nopportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t \\nyield any income and needs to be stored, often \\nat a cost. This interest rate dynamic can also be \\nindirectly observed through gold’s positive reaction \\nto past Federal Reserve rate cuts. In fact, in the six \\nmonths following the first rate cut of a cycle, gold \\nprices have rallied 60% of the time, by a median of \\n6.2% (see Exhibit 179). \\n\\n\\nHowever, the fact that disinflation is pushing \\ninterest rates lower could weaken this dynamic. That \\nhas been the case historically, as real interest rates \\nhave been a more important driver of gold prices \\nthan nominal interest rates. Falling but positive real \\nrates, which we expect this year, have historically \\nbeen roughly neutral for gold prices compared to \\ntheir unconditional performance. Capitalizing on \\nthese rate movements also requires precise timing, as \\nthe median gold return in the six months before the \\nfirst Federal Reserve rate cut has been a 1.9% loss, \\nwith only a 50% chance of a gain. \\n\\n\\nWe do not expect the US dollar \\nto provide a clear catalyst to gold \\nprices either. While there is a negative \\ncorrelation between gold and the \\ndollar, it has historically taken a large \\ndollar depreciation to push gold prices \\nmeaningfully higher, which is not our \\ncentral case. In fact, we expect the dollar \\nto appreciate this year. \\nThere is nothing quite as captivating \\nto investors as a new all-time high—\\nlike that reached by gold in late \\nDecember last year.\\n\\n\\nIn short, we do not believe these conflicting \\nfactors convincingly justify today’s already high \\ngold prices, leaving us neutral until a clearer \\nopportunity presents itself.

       " Document(id='2025', metadata={}, page_content='Commodity markets often change the locks just \\nwhen investors think they have found the keys. \\nRecent years have been no exception: investors \\ngained confidence after two consecutive years of \\nexcess returns in 2021 and 2022—fueled by supply \\nchain disruptions, rising inflation and Russia’s \\ninvasion of Ukraine—only to be caught off guard \\nby losses in 2023 and just a modest rebound last \\nyear. The GSCI’s 4% return in 2024 also masked \\nuneven performance across subsectors. Gains in \\nprecious metals and livestock weren’t enough to \\noffset losses in agriculture and industrial metals.\\n\\n\\nThe relative stability in energy prices last year \\nstood in stark contrast to pervasive geopolitical \\nrisks and moderating demand growth. This \\nresilience reflected historically high spare capacity \\nin oil markets, which helped balance declining \\ninventories and modest periodic disruptions. \\nLooking ahead, we expect steady global economic \\ngrowth to support demand, while ample spare \\ncapacity should again keep prices in check, barring \\na major supply disruption.\\n\\n\\nGold emerged as a standout performer last \\nyear, reaching a new all-time high in October and \\noutperforming the S&P 500 with a 27% spot \\nreturn. Its strength was driven by a combination of \\nfactors, including elevated central bank purchases, \\nmonetary easing, rising national debt concerns and \\ngeopolitical risks.\\n\\n\\nWhile we remain neutral on commodities \\noverall, we continue to recommend a small \\noverweight to uranium, which we believe offers \\nattractive asymmetry given an ongoing structural \\ndeficit (see Section I, Our Tactical Tilts).\\n\\n\\nOil: Uneasy Equilibrium\\nOil did not live up to its reputation for volatility \\nin 2024. Prices traded within their tightest range \\nsince 2013 in percentage terms and within their \\nnarrowest range since 1998 in real dollar terms. \\nWTI crude oil spent nearly 80% of 2024 within \\nour expected trading range of $60–80 and ended \\nthe year flat. This uncharacteristic stability reflected \\na balanced oil market, where ample spare capacity, \\ndisciplined production and moderating demand \\ngrowth combined to offset geopolitical risks.  \\n\\n\\nSupply disruptions remained modest despite \\nactive military conflicts in the Middle East \\nand Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. OPEC+ \\nmaintained remarkable discipline, extending \\nproduction cut agreements through 2026 and \\npostponing plans to unwind cuts. This resulted \\nin historically high spare capacity, providing a \\nbuffer against unexpected supply shocks (see \\nExhibit 183). Meanwhile, global oil demand \\ngrowth slowed for a third straight year, even as \\nconsumption demand recovered from pandemic \\ndistortions and reached a new all-time high.\\n\\n\\nLooking ahead to 2025, we expect trend-like \\nglobal economic activity to drive oil demand \\nhigher by around 1 million b/d, similar to last \\nyear. However, Chinese demand growth is likely to \\nremain subdued at around 0.1–0.2 million b/d due \\nto its slower economic growth (see Section II) and \\na shift away from petroleum-consuming passenger \\nand freight transportation vehicles. This would \\nleave China’s demand growth trailing India’s for a \\nsecond year (see Exhibit 184).\\n\\n\\nTo keep the market in balance, oil supply will \\nneed to increase to meet demand growth. Increased \\noil production is most likely to come from among \\nnon-OPEC+ countries, which now contribute the \\nmajority of global oil supply (see Exhibit 185). \\nIndeed, the approximately 1.2 million b/d in supply \\ngrowth we expect from countries such as the US, \\nGuyana, Brazil and Canada is sufficient to satisfy \\nglobal demand growth on its own. Moreover, much \\nof this expected growth arises from large-scale \\noffshore developments whose production is not \\nsensitive to market oil prices. \\n\\n\\nGiven this non-OPEC+ growth, the burden of \\nmanaging supply relative to demand rests with \\nOPEC+. We expect the group to maintain its recent \\nsupply discipline this year unless prices move \\nsustainably higher. This should ensure ample spare \\ncapacity to absorb unexpected disruptions. \\n\\n\\nGiven a roughly balanced oil market, we \\nexpect WTI crude oil prices to end 2025 in a range \\nof $60–80, consistent with the current forward \\ncurve and last year’s range. That said, risks to our \\noutlook remain. OPEC’s spare capacity provides a \\ntangible buffer, but the oil market’s other buffer—\\nobservable global oil inventories—is near multiyear \\nlows (see Exhibit 186). Additionally, OPEC+ could \\nchoose not to respond swiftly to a supply shock, \\nwhile weaker global demand, a lapse in OPEC+ \\nproduction discipline and larger-than-expected \\nnon-OPEC+ production growth could also test \\nmarket stability. \\n\\n\\nPolicy uncertainty also looms. The incoming \\nTrump administration may tighten sanctions on \\nIran, Russia and Venezuela, but is likely to prioritize \\nlow energy prices—balancing geopolitical objectives \\nwith domestic economic considerations. Meanwhile, \\nwhile deregulation could increase oil drilling \\npermits, logistical bottlenecks and US producers’ \\ncapital discipline make a production surge unlikely. \\n\\n\\nGiven these crosscurrents, we do not hold an \\nactive tactical position in oil currently. Instead, \\nwe continue to recommend a small overweight to \\nthe US midstream sector, which offers strong cash \\nflows, benefits from growing energy volumes and \\nhas less direct exposure to oil price volatility.\\nGold: Golden Crossroads\\nNo other commodity shined as brightly as gold \\nlast year, with its 27% surge marking the best \\nannual performance in a decade. Gold’s strength \\nwas notable for reflecting familiar drivers—\\nsizable central bank purchases, easier monetary \\npolicy, rising national debt levels and pervasive \\ngeopolitical risks—while also defying traditional \\nheadwinds, including rising real interest rates and a \\nstronger US dollar. Last year marked only the third \\ntime since 1997 in which gold rallied despite these \\nheadwinds, although its inverse correlation with \\nUS real interest rates has weakened in recent years \\n(see Exhibit 187). \\n\\n\\nThis breakdown of once-reliable relationships \\nunderscores a notable shift in the appeal of gold \\namong key buyers. Central banks—particularly in \\ncountries such as China, India and Türkiye—have \\nsharply increased gold purchases in recent years \\nas part of broader efforts to diversify foreign \\nexchange reserves and reduce reliance on the US \\ndollar. Heightened trade uncertainty, geopolitical \\ntensions, and the US dollar’s use in sanctions \\nhave further bolstered gold’s appeal in these \\nbuyers’ eyes. \\n\\n\\nGlobal central bank purchases of gold topped \\n1,000 tonnes in 2022–23 and were on track \\nto reach similar levels again late last year (see \\nExhibit 188). Consumer demand in emerging \\nmarkets has also surged, driven by gold’s enduring \\nreputation as both a store of value and a hedge \\nagainst geopolitical risk. Collectively, this \\ndemand has supported prices even amid volatile \\nmacroeconomic conditions. \\n\\n\\nThe renewed enthusiasm for gold is also visible \\nin investor positioning. While ETF holdings of \\ngold in volume terms actually declined in 2024, \\ntheir value in dollars reached an all-time high. \\nSimilarly, net speculative positioning in the futures \\nand options markets remains elevated, standing \\nin its 88th percentile since 1995. All told, global \\ninvestment demand accounted for about a quarter \\nof gold purchases through the third quarter of last \\nyear, roughly in line with long-run averages but \\nhigher than levels seen in 2021–23.\\n\\n\\nThe macroeconomic backdrop presents a \\nmore mixed outlook for gold. We forecast positive \\nbut falling real interest rates this year, which \\nhave historically been neutral for gold relative \\nto unconditional returns (see Exhibit 189). We \\nalso expect a modestly stronger dollar, which has \\nhistorically limited meaningful gold appreciation. \\nThat said, the reliability of both of these macro \\ndrivers has weakened in recent years, as discussed. \\n\\n\\nOn balance, these crosscurrents leave us neutral \\non gold prices from current levels. Central banks \\nhave been net buyers of gold for over a decade, \\nsuggesting their demand may be structural. \\nHowever, with gold already near all-time highs \\nand investors positioned for further upside, price \\nsensitivity among buyers is likely to increase.

      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "The document discusses the performance of commodities in financial markets during the past year, noting a notable 23% return in the S&P GSCI, though returns were uneven across individual commodities. Industrial and precious metals lost value, while the energy sector saw a significant gain primarily due to \"backwardation\" in futures pricing. The report highlights the ongoing tension between supply-side pressures, stemming from years of underinvestment, and demand-side concerns exacerbated by global economic slowdowns, particularly in China. Oil prices were notably influenced by geopolitical developments, especially the impact of sanctions on Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine, which led to brief spikes in prices around $124. A subsequent decline in prices was attributed to reduced demand and significant releases from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The document expresses uncertainty regarding future oil demand, projecting prices to range between $70 and $100, influenced by various geopolitical and economic factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the analysis on gold reveals its diminished status as an effective hedge against inflation, with prices struggling amid rising interest rates and a strong US dollar. The report remains neutral on gold due to these opposing influences, although acknowledges potential upside if a US recession increases demand as a safe-haven asset or if emerging market central banks increase their gold holdings. Overall, the report conveys a cautious outlook on commodities, acknowledging the interplay of risks and opportunities across various markets.\n",
      "**Document title: None**\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "The 2023 commodity market review reveals a marked decline, with the S&P GSCI falling 9% after two years of strong performance, diverging significantly from earlier supercycle expectations. Investor sentiment has shifted as high prices from previous years have prompted demand conservation and increases in supply capacity, particularly notable in oil production, which surpassed projections due to producers' capital discipline.\n",
      "\n",
      "While broad losses were observed across energy, agriculture, and industrial metals, uranium stood out with a remarkable 90% gain, and gold attracted attention for a 13% return. However, gold's forward outlook appears challenging for 2024, given its near-record pricing and a mixed fundamental environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the oil sector, investors faced the unpredictability of the market. Contrary to predictions, Russian sanctions did not severely curtail supply, as Russia redirected exports primarily to China and India. U.S. oil production continued to rise due to enhanced productivity, and a notable increase in output from non-OPEC nations like Brazil and Guyana poses additional supply pressure. As a result, oil prices ended 2023 with an 11% loss and are expected to stabilize between $60 to $80 in 2024, grappling with challenges in demand and potential geopolitical disruptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "For gold, despite reaching new highs in December 2023 due to bullish dynamics fueled by de-dollarization and safe-haven buying, the outlook is tempered by potential disinflation effects on interest rates and a stable U.S. dollar. The report concludes with a neutral stance on both oil and gold, indicating cautious investor sentiment amidst complex market dynamics while suggesting a continued overweight in uranium due to ongoing supply-demand disparities.\n",
      "**Document title: Commodity Market Update: 2024 Overview and Outlook**\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "The 2024 commodity market update highlights a modest recovery following the significant declines of 2023, with the S&P GSCI posting a 4% return that conceals volatility across various subsectors. While precious metals and livestock saw gains, losses in agriculture and industrial metals persisted, reflecting a fragmented market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Energy prices displayed unusual stability during 2024, attributed to high spare capacity, disciplined production from OPEC+, and slower global demand growth amid geopolitical uncertainties. Oil prices remained stable, trading consistently within a range of $60 to $80 as global economic activity continued to recover. The expectation for 2025 suggests a demand growth of approximately 1 million barrels per day, with a significant contribution anticipated from non-OPEC+ countries like the US, Guyana, and Brazil. However, risks persist if OPEC+ fails to maintain production discipline or if there are unexpected supply shocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the gold market, the precious metal emerged as a notable performer, achieving a 27% increase and reaching an all-time high in October 2024. This performance was bolstered by central bank purchases, geopolitical tensions, and sustained investor interest amid rising national debt concerns. Despite these dynamics, the forecast for gold remains neutral due to potential pressures from a stronger US dollar and fluctuating real interest rates, as investors may exhibit increased price sensitivity given the current high price environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while maintaining a neutral outlook on commodities broadly, the report emphasizes a continued overweight recommendation for uranium, owing to persistent structural supply-demand disparities. The insights reflect an ongoing adaptation to both macroeconomic trends and shifts in investor sentiment, underscoring the unpredictable nature of commodity markets in the face of geopolitical and economic influences.\n"

Investors also faced a wide \\ndispersion among individual commodities and their \\nsource of returns. In contrast to the index’s overall \\nstrength, both industrial metals and precious \\nmetals suffered losses last year. And while the \\nenergy subindex outperformed with a 39% gain, \\nthe bulk of this came from positive carry, or the \\nadditional return holders of a commodity get when \\nthe futures curve is strongly downward sloping, \\ncalled “backwardation.” The appreciation in spot \\nenergy prices was a much smaller 14%.'),\n",

The losses were broad-based, with negative \\nprice performance across energy, agriculture and \\nindustrial metals.  \\n\\n\\nThe high prices of commodities coming into \\nlast year proved to be the antidote for even higher \\nprices, as they incentivized a mix of demand \\nconservation, investment in supply capacity and \\nproductivity improvements. This dynamic was \\nparticularly visible in the oil patch last year, where \\nproduction exceeded expectations in several \\ncountries despite producers’ capital discipline. The \\nresulting spare capacity is likely to limit upside \\nagain this year, barring major supply disruptions.Outside of commonly traded commodity \\nindices, there were a couple bright spots. Uranium \\nsaw a strong rally, gaining 90% last year. We \\ncontinue to recommend a small overweight to \\nuranium, a position we initiated in March 2022 \\nbased on our view that the widening gap between \\nsupply and demand would push prices higher. With \\nsupply being slow to respond despite last year’s \\nrally, we expect uranium prices to rise further \\nthis year. \\n\\n\\nGold also stood out last year, posting a 13% \\nreturn.

As seen in Exhibit 181, close \\nto 10% of global oil production found itself at \\nrisk of disruption virtually overnight in the wake \\nof Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing \\nrollout of Western sanctions. Given already low \\nglobal oil inventories and thin spare capacity, oil \\nprices understandably spiked higher, reaching $124 \\nat their peak closing level last March. \\n\\n\\nPrices have since fallen back below pre-war \\nlevels. This surprising retracement reflects not only \\nthe failure of supply risks to materialize, but also \\na combination of bearish developments, including \\nan unprecedented 200-million-barrel release from \\nthe US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a COVID-\\ndriven slump in Chinese oil demand and fears of \\nan impending recession.Although oil prices have receded, the bullish \\nrisks that underpinned their initial spike higher \\nhave not disappeared. The full effect of European \\nsanctions on Russia will not be visible in energy \\nmarkets until the first quarter of this year. These \\ncurbs directly impact 0.5 million b/d of seaborne \\ncrude oil and 1.1 million b/d of refined products. \\nWhile Russia has so far been successful at \\nredirecting crude exports to India and China, this \\nstrategy is starting to show some limits (see Exhibit \\n182). Moreover, it will be difficult for Russia to \\nreplicate this strategy in refined products, as both \\nChina and India were net exporters in this category \\nlast year.As a result, close to 2 million b/d of Russian \\nsupplies to Europe remain at risk.

Instead, Russia successfully \\nredirected most of these sanctioned exports to \\nChina and India. Predictions of a slowdown in US \\nproduction growth also missed the mark, as US \\nproducers recorded their fastest growth rate since \\n2019. With these bullish catalysts not happening \\nthe way people thought they would, oil prices \\nended the year with a modest 11% loss.Oil begins the year trading at the lower end of \\nits annual range. However, this does not negate the \\npotential downside risks for 2024, as we anticipate \\nchallenges stemming from both demand and \\nsupply dynamics. Sustaining the recent demand \\ngrowth rate will be challenging now that the post-\\npandemic recovery has largely run its course. We \\npredict that demand growth will return to a trend-\\nlike pace of 1.0–1.5 million b/d this year in the \\nabsence of a recession, a significant deceleration \\nfrom last year’s 2.3 million b/d increase (see \\nExhibit 173).This slower demand growth will likely require \\nrestraint on the part of producers to keep the \\nmarket in balance. For their part, US producers \\nhave consistently demonstrated discipline in their \\nallocation of capital. Over the last 12 months, these \\nproducers have returned 49% of their cash flows \\nto investors compared to 37% per year between \\n2014 and 2019. However, productivity has also \\nimproved in recent years, such that the same dollar \\nof capital spending now generates more oil. As a \\nresult, US production is likely to continue growing \\ndespite ongoing capital discipline.The potential for output restraint among other \\nnon-OPEC producers is just as dubious. Brazil, \\nGuyana and Canada have all experienced a notable \\nuptick in their oil output recently. What’s \\nmore, their production is unlikely to be \\naffected by oil prices, as it stems from \\nyears of investment in offshore and oil \\nsands projects that are just now coming \\nonline. Ultimately, oil production from \\nthese projects could crowd out further \\nexpansion from US shale. \\nThe high prices of commodities \\ncoming into last year proved to be the \\nantidote for even higher prices.Against this backdrop, the burden of managing \\nsupply relative to demand rests with OPEC, where \\nthere is arguably little room for further reductions. \\nOPEC production already stands at 10-year lows \\nand has been higher than current levels 88% of \\nthe time in the past 20 years73 (see Exhibit 174). \\nSimilarly, the production of Saudi Arabia—often \\nconsidered the ultimate swing producer—has \\nseldom fallen below its current level. Going \\nforward, OPEC’s determination to support prices \\ncould be tested if further production cuts become \\nnecessary.

This disappointing performance was \\nyet another reminder that gold is subject to a \\nmultitude of often opposing factors.

Yet real rates are still likely \\nto remain in positive territory, which historically \\nhas resulted in lower-than-average gold returns \\n(see Exhibit 186). After all, positive interest rates \\ncreate an opportunity cost of holding gold, which \\ngenerates no cash flow or yield income and must \\nbe physically stored, often at a cost.We also do not see a compelling argument for \\ninvestors to replace their US dollar holdings with \\ngold this year, given our still constructive view on \\nthe currency.

However, this is not an incremental \\nsource of demand, as they purchased about the \\nsame amount the previous year (see Exhibit 178).As was the case last year, our expectation \\nfor lower nominal interest rates could also \\nbenefit gold. Recall that lower rates reduce the \\nopportunity cost of holding gold, which doesn’t \\nyield any income and needs to be stored, often \\nat a cost. This interest rate dynamic can also be \\nindirectly observed through gold’s positive reaction \\nto past Federal Reserve rate cuts. In fact, in the six \\nmonths following the first rate cut of a cycle, gold \\nprices have rallied 60% of the time, by a median of \\n6.2% (see Exhibit 179).However, the fact that disinflation is pushing \\ninterest rates lower could weaken this dynamic.

      "The 2023 outlook highlights commodities as a standout performer in the market, with the S&P GSCI achieving a 23% return, outperforming other asset classes for the second consecutive year. However, this gain masked a complex landscape, as returns peaked at 54% by early June but were cut in half during the latter half of the year. There was significant variability among individual commodities, with industrial and precious metals recording losses, while energy commodities excelled with a 39% gain primarily driven by the benefits of backwardation. Spot energy prices saw a modest increase of 14%, indicating that the performance of commodities was not uniform across the board.\n",

      "**Document Summary:**  \n",
      "The 2024 outlook reveals a stark contrast to the previous year's strong commodity performance, as the S&P GSCI declined by 9% in 2023. This downturn affected multiple sectors, including energy, agriculture, and industrial metals, dispelling the notion of an ongoing supercycle that had become prevalent among investors. High commodity prices in 2022 led to demand conservation and increased investments in supply capacity, particularly in the oil sector, where production exceeded expectations despite capital discipline among producers. This resulted in increased spare capacity, which is likely to suppress price increases in 2024 unless significant supply disruptions occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, there were notable exceptions within the commodity landscape. Uranium experienced a remarkable 90% rally, and the outlook remains positive as supply struggles to keep up with the rising demand. The report recommends maintaining a small overweight position in uranium, emphasizing the expected continued upward price movement due to the persistent supply-demand gap. Gold also had a strong performance with a 13% return, but the report cautions that its prospects may be hindered in 2024 due to near-record prices and a more complex fundamental environment, contrasting with the previous bullish sentiment for the metal.\n",

      "**Document Summary:**  \n",
      "The 2025 outlook highlights the volatile nature of commodity markets, where investor confidence was recently shaken after two strong years of returns in 2021 and 2022, followed by losses in 2023 and a modest rebound in 2024 with a 4% GSCI return. The performance varied significantly across subsectors, with precious metals and livestock showing gains that could not offset declines in agriculture and industrial metals. Stability in energy prices amid geopolitical risks and moderated demand growth was attributed to historically high spare capacity in oil markets, balancing lower inventories and temporary disruptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking forward, steady global economic growth is expected to support commodity demand while ample spare capacity should keep prices relatively stable, barring significant supply issues. Gold emerged as a particularly strong performer, achieving a 27% return, marking its best year in a decade and surpassing the S&P 500. This surge was driven by factors such as substantial central bank purchases, monetary easing, concerns over national debt, and ongoing geopolitical tensions. Despite traditional headwinds such as rising real interest rates and a stronger US dollar, gold's performance remained robust, indicating a shift in market dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to oil, where no active tactical position is recommended, a small overweight in the US midstream sector is suggested due to its strong cash flows, benefit from increasing energy volumes, and reduced exposure to oil price fluctuations. Overall, while gold's standout performance continues to resonate from the prior year, the outlook emphasizes the need for a cautious approach in navigating the broader commodity landscape.\n"

However, this performance masked deeper complexities, as returns peaked at 54% by early June, only to decline significantly in the latter half of the year. It notes a stark difference in performance among individual commodities; while the energy sector was bolstered by a 39% gain largely attributed to positive carry from backwardation, both industrial and precious metals experienced losses.

      "The 2024 Outlook reflects on the significant downturn in commodity performance in 2023, marking a 9% decline in the GSCI after two years of strong returns that had led to expectations of a supercycle. This decline was widespread across sectors, including energy, agriculture, and industrial metals. The previous year's high commodity prices led to increased conservation and upgrades in supply capacity, particularly in oil production, which exceeded expectations and created spare capacity that may restrain price increases in 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notable exceptions emerged outside of major commodity indices, most prominently uranium, which surged by 90% last year.

      "The 2025 Outlook illustrates a complex landscape in commodity markets following the mixed performance of recent years. After notable excess returns in 2021 and 2022 prompted investor optimism, the GSCI experienced a dip in 2023 and only a modest 4% rebound in 2024, with uneven performance across subsectors. While precious metals and livestock saw gains, losses in agriculture and industrial metals dampened overall performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report highlights that energy prices remained relatively stable against a backdrop of geopolitical risks and moderated demand growth, aided by historically high spare capacity in oil markets, which cushioned the impact of reverting inventories and minor disruptions.

      "Gold emerged as a significant strong performer last year, reaching an all-time high in October with a 27% spot return, driven by robust central bank purchases, easing monetary policies, and rising national debt concerns. These factors contributed to gold's effective performance despite traditional headwinds such as rising real interest rates and a stronger US dollar. The Outlook advises against an active tactical position in oil, instead recommending a small overweight in the US midstream sector, which promises strong cash flows and benefits from growing energy volumes while being less sensitive to oil price fluctuations.\n",

      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The 2024 Outlook document reflects on the challenges faced by commodity investors in 2023, contrasting sharply with the optimism stemming from two previously strong years. The GSCI experienced a decline of 9% in 2023, marking a downturn across various sectors including energy, agriculture, and industrial metals. Elevated commodity prices from previous years ultimately curbed demand, prompting conservation efforts, increased investment in supply capacity, and enhanced productivity, especially notable in the oil sector where production surpassed expectations despite disciplined capital expenditure among producers. This resulted in spare capacity likely to restrain price increases unless significant supply disruptions occur.\n",

      "On a more positive note, uranium emerged as a standout, with prices surging by 90% in 2023, leading to a recommendation for a small overweight position in uranium investments. The expectation is for further price increases as supply struggles to keep pace with demand. Gold also performed well, achieving a 13% return, but the outlook for 2024 is viewed as more challenging due to near-record prices and uncertain market fundamentals. This nuanced perspective builds on the complex landscape highlighted in the previous document, emphasizing the significant shifts in investor sentiment and market dynamics.\n",

      "**Summary:**\n",
      "The 2025 Outlook document presents a nuanced view of the commodity market landscape following a tumultuous period characterized by fluctuating investor confidence. After experiencing challenges in 2023, where the GSCI saw a modest 4% return in 2024 amid uneven sector performance, the outlook reflects a cautious optimism for the future. Precious metals, particularly gold, have emerged as leading performers, with gold skyrocketing to a new all-time high in October 2024 and delivering a remarkable 27% return, significantly outpacing the S&P 500. This surge is attributed to several contributing factors, including increased central bank purchases, monetary easing, rising national debt, and ongoing geopolitical tensions, despite traditional challenges like rising real interest rates and a stronger US dollar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document underscores the resilience of energy prices amidst geopolitical risks, driven largely by high spare capacity in oil markets which has stabilized prices against fluctuating demand. Looking ahead, a steady global economic growth is expected to support commodity demand. However, sufficient spare capacity continues to signal that prices may remain restrained unless major supply disruptions occur. While the report does not advocate for a tactical position in oil, it suggests maintaining a small overweight in the US midstream sector, which is seen as resilient due to strong cash flows and minimal exposure to oil price volatility.\n",

While gains in precious metals and livestock were achieved, they were insufficient to offset declines in agriculture and industrial metals. Energy prices showed stability despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and slowing demand growth, attributed to historically high spare capacity in oil markets that helped manage declining inventories.\n",

      "Gold emerged as a particularly strong performer, achieving a 27% return and reaching an all-time high in October, driven by significant central bank purchases, monetary easing, and rising geopolitical concerns, marking its best performance in a decade.
