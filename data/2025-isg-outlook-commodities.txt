Commodity markets often change the locks just 
when investors think they have found the keys. 
Recent years have been no exception: investors 
gained confidence after two consecutive years of 
excess returns in 2021 and 2022—fueled by supply 
chain disruptions, rising inflation and Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine—only to be caught off guard 
by losses in 2023 and just a modest rebound last 
year. The GSCI’s 4% return in 2024 also masked 
uneven performance across subsectors. Gains in 
precious metals and livestock weren’t enough to 
offset losses in agriculture and industrial metals.


The relative stability in energy prices last year 
stood in stark contrast to pervasive geopolitical 
risks and moderating demand growth. This 
resilience reflected historically high spare capacity 
in oil markets, which helped balance declining 
inventories and modest periodic disruptions. 
Looking ahead, we expect steady global economic 
growth to support demand, while ample spare 
capacity should again keep prices in check, barring 
a major supply disruption.


Gold emerged as a standout performer last 
year, reaching a new all-time high in October and 
outperforming the S&P 500 with a 27% spot 
return. Its strength was driven by a combination of 
factors, including elevated central bank purchases, 
monetary easing, rising national debt concerns and 
geopolitical risks.


While we remain neutral on commodities 
overall, we continue to recommend a small 
overweight to uranium, which we believe offers 
attractive asymmetry given an ongoing structural 
deficit (see Section I, Our Tactical Tilts).


Oil: Uneasy Equilibrium
Oil did not live up to its reputation for volatility 
in 2024. Prices traded within their tightest range 
since 2013 in percentage terms and within their 
narrowest range since 1998 in real dollar terms. 
WTI crude oil spent nearly 80% of 2024 within 
our expected trading range of $60–80 and ended 
the year flat. This uncharacteristic stability reflected 
a balanced oil market, where ample spare capacity, 
disciplined production and moderating demand 
growth combined to offset geopolitical risks.  


Supply disruptions remained modest despite 
active military conflicts in the Middle East 
and Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. OPEC+ 
maintained remarkable discipline, extending 
production cut agreements through 2026 and 
postponing plans to unwind cuts. This resulted 
in historically high spare capacity, providing a 
buffer against unexpected supply shocks (see 
Exhibit 183). Meanwhile, global oil demand 
growth slowed for a third straight year, even as 
consumption demand recovered from pandemic 
distortions and reached a new all-time high.


Looking ahead to 2025, we expect trend-like 
global economic activity to drive oil demand 
higher by around 1 million b/d, similar to last 
year. However, Chinese demand growth is likely to 
remain subdued at around 0.1–0.2 million b/d due 
to its slower economic growth (see Section II) and 
a shift away from petroleum-consuming passenger 
and freight transportation vehicles. This would 
leave China’s demand growth trailing India’s for a 
second year (see Exhibit 184).


To keep the market in balance, oil supply will 
need to increase to meet demand growth. Increased 
oil production is most likely to come from among 
non-OPEC+ countries, which now contribute the 
majority of global oil supply (see Exhibit 185). 
Indeed, the approximately 1.2 million b/d in supply 
growth we expect from countries such as the US, 
Guyana, Brazil and Canada is sufficient to satisfy 
global demand growth on its own. Moreover, much 
of this expected growth arises from large-scale 
offshore developments whose production is not 
sensitive to market oil prices. 


Given this non-OPEC+ growth, the burden of 
managing supply relative to demand rests with 
OPEC+. We expect the group to maintain its recent 
supply discipline this year unless prices move 
sustainably higher. This should ensure ample spare 
capacity to absorb unexpected disruptions. 


Given a roughly balanced oil market, we 
expect WTI crude oil prices to end 2025 in a range 
of $60–80, consistent with the current forward 
curve and last year’s range. That said, risks to our 
outlook remain. OPEC’s spare capacity provides a 
tangible buffer, but the oil market’s other buffer—
observable global oil inventories—is near multiyear 
lows (see Exhibit 186). Additionally, OPEC+ could 
choose not to respond swiftly to a supply shock, 
while weaker global demand, a lapse in OPEC+ 
production discipline and larger-than-expected 
non-OPEC+ production growth could also test 
market stability. 


Policy uncertainty also looms. The incoming 
Trump administration may tighten sanctions on 
Iran, Russia and Venezuela, but is likely to prioritize 
low energy prices—balancing geopolitical objectives 
with domestic economic considerations. Meanwhile, 
while deregulation could increase oil drilling 
permits, logistical bottlenecks and US producers’ 
capital discipline make a production surge unlikely. 


Given these crosscurrents, we do not hold an 
active tactical position in oil currently. Instead, 
we continue to recommend a small overweight to 
the US midstream sector, which offers strong cash 
flows, benefits from growing energy volumes and 
has less direct exposure to oil price volatility.
Gold: Golden Crossroads
No other commodity shined as brightly as gold 
last year, with its 27% surge marking the best 
annual performance in a decade. Gold’s strength 
was notable for reflecting familiar drivers—
sizable central bank purchases, easier monetary 
policy, rising national debt levels and pervasive 
geopolitical risks—while also defying traditional 
headwinds, including rising real interest rates and a 
stronger US dollar. Last year marked only the third 
time since 1997 in which gold rallied despite these 
headwinds, although its inverse correlation with 
US real interest rates has weakened in recent years 
(see Exhibit 187). 


This breakdown of once-reliable relationships 
underscores a notable shift in the appeal of gold 
among key buyers. Central banks—particularly in 
countries such as China, India and Türkiye—have 
sharply increased gold purchases in recent years 
as part of broader efforts to diversify foreign 
exchange reserves and reduce reliance on the US 
dollar. Heightened trade uncertainty, geopolitical 
tensions, and the US dollar’s use in sanctions 
have further bolstered gold’s appeal in these 
buyers’ eyes. 


Global central bank purchases of gold topped 
1,000 tonnes in 2022–23 and were on track 
to reach similar levels again late last year (see 
Exhibit 188). Consumer demand in emerging 
markets has also surged, driven by gold’s enduring 
reputation as both a store of value and a hedge 
against geopolitical risk. Collectively, this 
demand has supported prices even amid volatile 
macroeconomic conditions. 


The renewed enthusiasm for gold is also visible 
in investor positioning. While ETF holdings of 
gold in volume terms actually declined in 2024, 
their value in dollars reached an all-time high. 
Similarly, net speculative positioning in the futures 
and options markets remains elevated, standing 
in its 88th percentile since 1995. All told, global 
investment demand accounted for about a quarter 
of gold purchases through the third quarter of last 
year, roughly in line with long-run averages but 
higher than levels seen in 2021–23.


The macroeconomic backdrop presents a 
more mixed outlook for gold. We forecast positive 
but falling real interest rates this year, which 
have historically been neutral for gold relative 
to unconditional returns (see Exhibit 189). We 
also expect a modestly stronger dollar, which has 
historically limited meaningful gold appreciation. 
That said, the reliability of both of these macro 
drivers has weakened in recent years, as discussed. 


On balance, these crosscurrents leave us neutral 
on gold prices from current levels. Central banks 
have been net buyers of gold for over a decade, 
suggesting their demand may be structural. 
However, with gold already near all-time highs 
and investors positioned for further upside, price 
sensitivity among buyers is likely to increase.
